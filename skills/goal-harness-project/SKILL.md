# Goal Harness Project Workflow

Use this skill when the task mentions Goal Harness, goal-harness, a project goal
document, multi-project dashboard/status, stale latest run,
`.goal-harness/registry.json`, `.codex/goals`, `refresh-state`,
`sync-global`, or connecting a new repo.

Goal Harness has two layers:

- **Project-local state**: each repo owns `.goal-harness/registry.json` and
  `.codex/goals/<goal-id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`.
- **Shared local control plane**: `~/.codex/goal-harness` stores run history and
  `registry.global.json` for multi-project status.

Do not manually copy one project's registry entry into another project. Local
`connect` and `refresh-state` should sync into the shared global registry
automatically.

## Preflight

From the target project shell:

```bash
goal-harness doctor
```

If `goal-harness` is not on PATH:

```bash
install_script="$HOME/goal-harness/scripts/install-local.sh"
if [ -x "$install_script" ]; then
  "$install_script"
  export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
goal-harness doctor
```

If this still fails, report the exact missing piece and do not fake a successful
connection.

## Connect A New Project

1. Read the project goal document and inspect the repo narrowly.
2. Extract a stable `goal_id`, one-line `objective`, `domain`, authority
   sources, validation surfaces, first safe action, and public/private
   boundary.
3. Run `connect` from the project root. Prefer read-only until the goal doc
   explicitly authorizes mutation:

```bash
goal-harness connect \
  --goal-id <STABLE_GOAL_ID> \
  --objective "<OBJECTIVE_FROM_GOAL_DOC>" \
  --domain <DOMAIN> \
  --goal-doc <GOAL_DOC_PATH> \
  --adapter-kind read_only_project_map_v0 \
  --adapter-status connected-read-only
```

`connect` should create or update the local registry/state and auto-sync the
public-safe entry into `~/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json`.

If the goal state or registry contains private evidence, add `.goal-harness/`
and `.codex/goals/` to that project's `.gitignore`.

For a generic read-only connection, create the first non-generic map run:

```bash
goal-harness read-only-map --goal-id <STABLE_GOAL_ID>
```

This reads registry metadata, the active state, and a bounded project-file
inventory, then appends a `read_only_project_map` run. Use it before writing a
project-specific adapter when the dashboard would otherwise stay on
`state_refreshed` or `connected_without_run`.

For a planned high-complexity adapter, preview the same bounded map before
controller opt-in:

```bash
goal-harness read-only-map --goal-id <STABLE_GOAL_ID> --dry-run
```

If the adapter status is `planned`, only the `--dry-run` preview is allowed and
the result should include `opt_in_required=true`. Do not append a real map until
the user or target controller has moved the adapter to `read-only-map-ready`,
`connected-read-only`, or `connected`. Relay the returned `residual_risks`
labels directly; do not invent a separate free-form risk summary.

## Refresh State After Non-Adapter Work

If the agent updated `ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`, a progress ledger, a planning doc,
or external coordination state without producing a new adapter run, append a
state-only refresh:

```bash
goal-harness refresh-state --goal-id <STABLE_GOAL_ID>
```

This fixes stale dashboards where the latest run still shows an old
`ready_for_controller_opt_in` or similar state. It also auto-syncs the project
entry into the global registry. If you do not pass `--recommended-action`, the
refresh run should publish the first public-safe line from `## Next Action` as
the compact dashboard action; keep raw evidence and private links in the state
file, not in that action line.

## Record Human Reward

When the user gives a clear reward judgment for an exact run, first validate
the overlay and active-state writeback:

```bash
goal-harness reward \
  --goal-id <STABLE_GOAL_ID> \
  --run-generated-at <RUN_GENERATED_AT> \
  --decision <DECISION_LABEL> \
  --reward positive \
  --reason-summary "<PUBLIC_SAFE_CHINESE_REASON>" \
  --follow-up "<PUBLIC_SAFE_NEXT_ACTION>" \
  --write-active-state-summary \
  --dry-run
```

Only after the user has explicitly approved recording the reward, rerun without
`--dry-run`. The durable source of truth is still the run-bound
`human_reward` overlay. The active-state writeback is a `Progress Ledger`
summary for future agents; project agents should read the reward through the
returned `project_agent_visibility.history_command`.

## Multi-Project Status

Inside a project:

```bash
goal-harness status
```

Outside a project, `goal-harness status` should fall back to:

```text
~/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json
```

Use explicit sync only for diagnosis or recovery:

```bash
goal-harness sync-global
```

If status shows `unregistered_runtime_goal`:

- If the project is active, run `goal-harness sync-global` or reconnect from
  that project's local registry.
- If the runtime record is obsolete, preview cleanup with
  `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id <GOAL_ID>` and only execute cleanup
  when that is clearly intended.

## Validation

After connect or refresh, run the smallest useful set:

```bash
goal-harness registry
goal-harness status
goal-harness check --scan-path <PUBLIC_SAFE_FILE_OR_DIR>
```

For multi-project UI updates, refresh the dashboard status JSON from the global
registry:

```bash
goal-harness --registry "$HOME/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json" \
  --format json status > <dashboard>/public/status.local.json
```

## Reporting

Report in Chinese when the user is reviewing:

- changed files and whether they are public or local-private;
- validation commands and results;
- how the goal appears in dashboard or attention queue;
- the next safe action;
- any missing gates before decision-advisor or write-controller behavior.

Never include credentials, private docs, raw internal links, production task
ids, or raw local evidence in public repo docs or examples.
