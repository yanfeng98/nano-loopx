"""The LoopX arm, driven through LoopX's own product path.

The first LoopX arm measured the wrong thing.  It called `loopx turn run-once`
from an outer loop of my own, four times, against a goal document I hand-wrote
with four stages in it.  `benchmark/deepswe/README.md` rules that out in as
many words -- the treatment must not be "an outer polling loop labeled as Goal
mode" -- and it makes the distinction a formal gate: "a clean run can still be
uncountable when the treatment did not execute the preregistered LoopX path".
Under LoopX's own standard those 54 results are uncountable.  They describe my
wrapper, not this product.

The real path, all of it LoopX's:

    profile install (modes/profile_install.py)
                                      scripts/install-local.sh builds a release
                                      snapshot and installs the LoopX skills
                                      into a profile-owned CODEX_HOME
    loopx bootstrap                   LoopX writes .loopx/registry.json and
                                      .codex/goals/<id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md,
                                      with its own execution profile
    loopx configure-goal              registers the peer identity
    loopx heartbeat-prompt --thin     the installed CLI renders the real Goal
                                      body -- the thing I used to hand-write
    run_native_goal_process_until_terminal
                                      codex app-server owns continuation while
                                      the Goal stays active; nothing here counts
                                      turns

`required_skill_ids` makes `skills/list` a precondition of thread creation, so a
run in which Codex never discovered the LoopX skills fails before model work
instead of quietly scoring as a LoopX result.

Everything Pier does to stand Codex up is inherited from GoalCodex, which also
already owns the app-server transaction (it copies LoopX's own
`native_codex_goal.py` into the container).  Only three things differ from the
Goal arm: where CODEX_HOME points, who wrote the objective, and whether the
skills gate is armed.  That is the intended contrast -- the same host, the same
transaction, LoopX present or absent.

The profile is built on the host and shipped, rather than installed in the
container: `install-local.sh` is offline (no pip, npm, curl, wget, git clone or
apt in 872 lines, so the sandbox is not the obstacle), but it verifies that its
source tree is a clean checkout, and the container receives a tarball of the
`loopx` package with no `.git` to verify.  Building it once on the host keeps
`source_clean` a real claim.  Both sides use the same absolute path so the
release snapshot's symlinks stay valid.

Usage:

    MR_AGENT=loopx_native_codex:LoopxNativeCodex MR_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.5 \
      ./run.sh --all -i <task>

Environment:

    MR_LOOPX_PREFLIGHT=1     prove skills discovery and Goal attachment, then
                             stop before any model turn -- costs nothing
    MR_LOOPX_PROFILE_ROOT    where the profile lives on host and in container
                             (default /tmp/loopx-profile; must match on both)
    MR_LOOPX_ROOT            LoopX checkout to install from
    MR_GOAL_TIMEOUT_SEC      ceiling for the continuation loop
