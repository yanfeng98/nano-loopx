"""Drive one DeepSWE task through LoopX's governed Turn loop, inside the container.

Run by LoopxCodex after the LoopX package, the Codex profile and the goal state
have been staged.  Kept as a standalone script for the same reason
native_codex_goal.py is: it must execute where the repository is, and the
repository is inside the task container.

Why this calls ``handle_turn_command`` instead of the ``loopx turn run-once``
CLI: the CLI restricts ``--codex-sandbox`` to read-only and workspace-write,
and neither can be set up inside these task images — the Linux sandbox needs
kernel features the container does not grant, and Codex responds by narrating
instead of executing (measured once: 431 assistant messages, zero command
executions, an empty patch scored 0/24).  The other two arms run Codex with
approvals and sandbox bypassed, so the LoopX arm has to as well or the three
differ in permissions as well as in looping.  Editing LoopX's argparse choices
would also have made the source tree dirty, and the profile installer
refuses an unclean source because mixing revisions invalidates a benchmark
treatment.  Building the Namespace directly avoids both problems and touches
no file in the LoopX checkout.

The loop is the point of the arm.  LoopX runs exactly one governed Turn per
call: it selects a Todo, has the host adapter invoke Codex, requires an
independent validator to prove the postcondition, and only then commits the
result and spends quota.  Multi-turn behaviour comes from calling it again --
which is precisely what the other two arms never do, since `codex exec` and the
app-server both stop as soon as the model says it is finished.
