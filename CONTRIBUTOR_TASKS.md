# Contributor Task Board

This board is the public, contributor-facing projection of LoopX work.
It is intentionally different from `.local` active goal state:

- this file lists public work that can be discussed, claimed, reviewed, and
  validated in the repository;
- `.local`, `.loopx`, and live `ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md` files remain local
  runtime data for maintainers and automation;
- private benchmark traces, verifier output, raw agent sessions, credentials,
  internal document links, and local machine paths must not be copied here.

The goal is to make important work discoverable without turning the repository
into a mirror of maintainer scratch state.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Available | Ready for someone to comment on the linked issue or open a small PR. |
| Claimed | Someone has said they are working on it, or a maintainer assigned it. |
| Maintainer-owned | Active work is happening in maintainer/local automation; ask before touching. |
| Needs design | Discussion is welcome, but implementation needs agreement first. |
| Blocked | Waiting on a decision, dependency, or maintainer writeback. |
| Done | Completed and ready to archive from this board. |

## How To Claim Work

1. Prefer a linked GitHub issue. If there is no issue yet, open one with the
   contributor task template.
2. Comment that you would like to work on the task. Maintainers will mark it
   `claimed` or suggest a smaller slice.
3. For docs-only typo fixes or obviously tiny cleanups, opening a direct PR is
   fine.
4. If a claimed task has no update for 14 days, maintainers may release it back
   to `Available` after one ping.
5. If a task is `Maintainer-owned`, do not duplicate the work. Ask whether
   there is a public helper slice instead.

## Current Public Tasks

Start with **Starter** tasks if this is your first contribution. Choose
**Focused** tasks if you are comfortable running local smokes. Pick **Advanced**
tasks only when you are ready to touch shared state, adapters, or concurrency.
Use **Design/RFC** tasks to shape direction before implementation.

## Product Manager Cut

LoopX is currently converging from a control-plane library into a management
surface for long-running agent work. Product-capability contributions should
prefer slices that make existing kernel objects understandable to users instead
of adding another source of truth.

| Product slice | Current substrate | Contributor-sized next cut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Management frontstage | Goals, todos, gates, claims, evidence, quota, run history, `goal_channel_projection_v0`, and `task_graph_projection_v0` are already compact status projections. | Translate these into operator concepts such as work item, owner, decision, evidence, budget, risk, and next action; keep raw machine fields in drill-downs. |
| Conversational commands | `global_manager_command_v0` defines read-only commands such as `/loopx-global-summary`, `/loopx-global-gates`, `/loopx-global-todos`, and `/loopx-global-risks`; legacy `/loop-global-*` forms are only migration aliases. | Implement one canonical command at a time with a public-safe smoke and no alias sprawl. Unknown commands should fail closed with help. |
| Runtime connector modes | The connector catalog names Codex App heartbeat, Codex CLI TUI, Claude Code loop, shell worker, HTTP webhook, and worker bridge as first-class modes. | Make mode selection visible and explicit. TUI, headless, IM/gateway, and hybrid handoffs are all valid product paths when they preserve identity, quota, and writeback. |
| Visible governance | Quota, scheduler hints, user gates, claims, side-agent handoff, repository policy, and interface budgets already exist in machine contracts. | Show who can act, who must approve, what budget was spent, and how pause/override/terminate decisions map back to LoopX state. |
| Domain packs | Domain capability packs default off; ML experiment and scenario/productization work should stay advisory until enabled by registry or owner authority. | Add suggest-only previews or public-safe fixtures before any domain-specific autonomy, launch, or production action. |

## Recent Maintainer Progress

These public milestones changed which tasks are still useful contributor entry
points:

| Area | Landed | Contributor implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI/runtime | `536ee63` extracted the ML experiment command group into `loopx/cli_commands/ml_experiment.py`; `9191a297` and `8450b51e` moved status-projection cache and local-state write correctness into `control_plane/runtime`; `8e23eae2` hardened SkillsBench Codex Goal TUI startup. | Do not redesign the module seam from scratch. Useful follow-ups are one more low-risk command-group extraction, better runtime-context docs/smokes, or CLI/TUI compatibility polish. |
| Todo/status/dashboard | `90c1d0c` shipped the Dashboard Project Todo Explorer and `6f0b88b` taught status to sync todo-index state from rollout events. | Do not rebuild the explorer or todo index wiring. Helpful slices are visual-acceptance polish, clearer demo fixtures, and small projection-correctness fixes that keep the browser surface read-only. |
| Product docs | `93ac1b2`, `b63a64e`, and `5e78262` defined the intelligent management surface, staged its adoption path, and added the project-level reward model. | The base docs are landed. Useful follow-ups are plain-language operator explanations, public-safe examples, and small contracts that connect reward, status, and user feedback without exposing local state. |
| Scenario productization | `6d5c51c` documented scenario capability state surfaces and `f2f480b` ranked the remaining substrate gaps. | New product/showcase work should follow the published scenario map. Good slices are `content_ops_surface_v0`, issue/PR maintainer intake, and signal-to-anchor fixtures instead of ad hoc product narratives. |
| Benchmark workflow | `939b02c` added ECS bootstrap tooling, Terminal-Bench no-upload smoke tooling, and a compact compose-startup reducer. SkillsBench verifier dependency prewarm now follows the same public-safe plan/smoke shape. | Do not recreate the ECS substrate. Help by extending the same wrapper/reducer shape to ALE, deepening SkillsBench no-upload case launch reducers, or improving route labels and public-safe reducers. |
| Autonomous replan | `d1f955a` made the autonomous-replan obligation smoke run in-process by default, with bounded subprocess coverage. | The broad smoke-performance cleanup is done. Future work should be a narrow regression or timeout guard, not another full rewrite. |
| Multi-agent coordination | `cb9f899`, `0f1ca9b`, `e73f9f1`, and `9acdaa2` landed soft todo claims, identity-aware heartbeat prompts, and side-agent self-merge policy; `23f447d3` and `483d3e9e` now scope and preserve agent lanes during autonomous replan. | Next public slices are agent profiles, claim-aware side-agent selection, agent-lane repair docs, and hard per-todo leases. |
| Capability packaging and install | `f817c99` moved Lark integrations under capability packages, `504fce9` added the GitHub reply monitor value connector, and `909292a` / `3a01471` clarified the README product/capability surface. | Do not restructure the top-level README again. Helpful follow-ups are capability-local docs, packaged-install troubleshooting, and contributor-safe examples that show how the capability packages fit together. |
| Showcases and README | `a384f41` and `f521471` made the public showcase catalog and README landing clearer. | New narrative work should add cases, visuals, or demo surfaces, not rebuild the landing-page frame. |
| Side-agent worktree guard | `47841a9`, `afc6aa7`, and the contributor-facing contract example made `quota should-run` / `spend-slot` fail closed when a side agent runs from the registered primary checkout. The status contract now also frames `workspace_guard` as an agent-channel repair for dashboard/review-packet consumers. | Do not duplicate the base guard, basic CLI example, or projection copy. Helpful follow-ups are claim-aware selection regressions and real UI rendering. |
| Identity-aware heartbeat routing | `724f823` scoped user gates by authoring agent, and the current `quota should-run` contract now blocks stale automation prompts that omit registered `--agent-id` / `--agent-scope`. | Do not weaken the identity gate. Good follow-ups are repair docs, focused smokes, and bounded payload/perf work that keeps identity-aware status/quota routing fast and legible. |
| Auto-research productization | Earlier slices proved visible launcher, worker-loop, role profile, and evidence append paths; `a7fd8067`, `8891dd3a`, and recent July 4 follow-ups tightened startup defaults and Codex CLI visible-goal reliability. | Keep the mainline focused on the generic multi-agent runner, pane-local LoopX tick, and a small action/evidence kernel. Do not revive board, acceptance-packet, public-claim, or showcase-projection layers in the kernel. |
| Canary planning and release guidance | `b58a824`, `25d61c1`, and `b202a13` shipped the catalog canary planner CLI plus the fixed-path and existing-contract selection rules. | Do not invent one-off canary chooser prompts. Helpful follow-ups are contributor-safe docs, fixture coverage, and bounded route-label polish around the shipped planner. |
| Reward-style replanning | `docs/product/reward-style-replanning.md` defines public-safe `replan_hint_v0` semantics: hints may reorder candidates but cannot override gates, claims, scope, capabilities, or boundaries. | The design note is done. Next slices should preview hints from compact reward/todo evidence and prove the hard-boundary precedence rules. |
| Goal channel projection | `4b5b46c` defined `goal_channel_projection_v0`; `6d37e3f` added the compact projection builder; `38bb58c` rendered it into static read-only frontstage HTML; the status feed now exports the same projection on `attention_queue.items[].goal_channel_projection`; the React `/frontstage` route now renders the projection as a read-only channel board with decision, quota, todo, claim, gate, timeline, warning, and truth-contract lanes. | Do not rebuild the base channel route. Helpful follow-ups are visual-acceptance polish, operator onboarding copy, richer local demo fixtures, and small interaction refinements that keep browser write authority outside the frontstage. |
| Runtime connector catalog | `docs/runtime-connector-catalog.md` defines the first public catalog for Codex App heartbeat, Codex CLI TUI, Claude Code loop, shell worker, HTTP webhook, and worker bridge connectors. | Do not introduce one-off prompt branches for a host runtime. Useful follow-ups are focused connector smokes, small status projections, and adapter-neutral planner fixtures that preserve scoped identity, quota, scheduler hints, and public/private boundaries. |
| Codex App scheduler and identity | `1d571343` added stateful Codex App scheduler backoff/reset-token handling across quota, prompt, docs, and focused smokes; `0b16911a` added agent-scoped todo list reads so automation prompts and manager surfaces can inspect the right backlog without dumping unrelated lanes. | Do not reintroduce unscoped heartbeat prompts or one-off scheduler state. Helpful slices are repair docs, focused connector/CLI smokes, and compact status projections that make scoped identity, scheduler ack, and no-spend cadence behavior legible to contributors. |
| Visible multi-agent / auto-research launcher | `3ce93d2b`, `aed32ab1`, and `050bd501` repaired worker-skill resolution, fixed visible demo startup, and improved the visible multi-agent human view. | Do not replace the launcher flow or invent a second demo path. Good follow-ups are operator walkthroughs, visual-acceptance polish, and bounded smokes/fixtures that keep the shipped launcher, role profiles, and frontstage story aligned. |
| SkillsBench runtime boundary | `56e1b532`, `2c60a594`, and `afc7cf73` tightened app-server first-action timeout handling, pre-agent setup attribution, and no-proxy egress support in the public SkillsBench workflow; `2413b447`, `8e23eae2`, and `9fd517bc` then made the Codex Goal route canonical, hardened TUI startup, and recorded compact app-goal setup tails in the public ledger. | Do not bypass the run-permission or preflight path. Useful follow-ups are reducer/display polish, public-safe docs, and focused route/attribution smokes that clarify launch-ready versus setup-blocked cases without publishing raw benchmark artifacts. |
| Operator task graph | `docs/reference/protocols/task-graph-projection-v0.md` and `docs/product/nontechnical-operator-status-model.md` frame task relationships and first-screen cards as read-only projections over existing LoopX state. | Do not build a second task store. Good follow-ups are public fixtures, frontstage graph rendering, and product copy that maps todos/gates/evidence/handoff to user-facing work relationships. |
| Benchmark lifecycle core | `loopx/benchmark_core/lifecycle.py`, `docs/research/long-horizon-agent-benchmarks/benchmark-core-adapter-contract-v0.md`, and `examples/benchmark-core-adapter-contract-smoke.py` define the adapter-neutral `preflight -> launch -> observe -> ingest -> classify -> ledger` contract and canonical lifecycle phases. | Do not recreate GH-C20. Useful follow-ups are GH-C21 accounting split, GH-C22 observable handles, and adapter-specific reducer adoption. |
| Benchmark run permission policy | `loopx/benchmark_core/run_permissions.py` and `examples/benchmark-run-permission-policy-smoke.py` define `run_permission_policy_v0` plus quota projection for local no-upload benchmark runs, and `43650a2` adds a public verifier-bootstrap preflight path for SkillsBench goal-start runs. | Do not recreate GH-C23 or bypass the preflight. Useful follow-ups are adapter-by-adapter launch packet adoption, UI display of `goal_boundary.run_permission_policy`, and public-safe docs that explain when benchmark work is launch-ready versus dependency-blocked. |
| Benchmark attempt accounting | `loopx/benchmark_core/attempts.py` and `examples/benchmark-attempt-accounting-smoke.py` define `benchmark_attempt_accounting_v0` with launcher/case/solver/verifier/official-score attempt phases and generic failure classes. | Do not recreate GH-C21. Useful follow-ups are adapter-by-adapter reducer adoption and ledger rendering of the split counts. |

### Starter / Good First

Low setup, docs-first, or narrow fixture work. These should be good entry
points for contributors who are still learning the repository.

| ID | Area | Task | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GH-C01 | docs | Add a short "first goal" walkthrough that starts with `loopx demo`, inspects status/history, completes one todo, and shows the next todo. | `loopx check --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs/ --scan-path examples/` |
| GH-C02 | tests | Add or extend a focused smoke test around todo archive/completion behavior. Prefer copying the style of `examples/control_plane/todo-lifecycle-cli-smoke.py`. | `python3 examples/control_plane/todo-lifecycle-cli-smoke.py` and `python3 -m py_compile loopx/*.py` |
| GH-C04 | docs | Improve README troubleshooting for install, PATH setup, canary/default wrappers, and `loopx doctor`. | `loopx check --scan-path README.md --scan-path CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| GH-C09 | release docs | Add a contributor-safe canary planner walkthrough: how to use the shipped catalog planner, how fixed-path vs existing-contract selection works, and how to stop before touching local `.loopx` or maintainer-only rollout state. | `loopx check --scan-path docs/interaction-pattern-catalog.md --scan-path docs/ --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C10 | docs | Add a public "what counts as a good smoke" guide using `CONTRIBUTING.md` and recent benchmark-smoke cleanup as source material. | `loopx check --scan-path CONTRIBUTING.md --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C13 | docs | Expand public/private boundary examples with realistic safe and unsafe snippets for benchmark traces, active state, local paths, credentials, and compact artifacts. | `loopx check --scan-path docs/public-private-boundary.md --scan-path examples/` |
| GH-C30 | docs | Add a "project asset contract" explainer showing owner, gate, next action, stop condition, last evidence, next safe command, user todo, agent todo, support mode, and fresh status projection. | `loopx check --scan-path docs/ --scan-path README.md` |
| GH-C53 | docs | Add a contributor-safe release/readiness explainer for default vs canary installs, packaged snapshots vs clone-based canary wrappers, promotion-readiness smokes, and when to stop before local `.loopx` or maintainer-only automation state. | `loopx check --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs/ --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C57 | docs | Add a contributor-safe heartbeat repair guide for identity-aware automation: when to regenerate `loopx heartbeat-prompt --thin --agent-id --agent-scope`, how stale unscoped prompts fail, how `scheduler_hint.codex_app` backoff/reset, `quota scheduler-ack`, `workspace_guard`, and `agent_scope_wait` fit together, and how to verify the repaired prompt without touching `.local` state. | `loopx check --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs/ --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C58 | docs | Add a capability-packaging explainer that connects the top-level README, `docs/capabilities/`, packaged install, and the first shipped value connector/Lark capability paths without leaking host-specific setup. | `loopx check --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs/capabilities --scan-path docs/product/codex-cli-packaged-install.md` |

### Focused Implementation

Small-to-medium code changes with a clear validation surface. These are good
for contributors who can run local CLI smokes and keep changes scoped.

| ID | Area | Task | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GH-C03 | diagnostics | Improve duplicate run-history index diagnostics so `loopx check` gives the next repair action, not only a warning. Include a small fixture or smoke path if practical. | `loopx check --scan-root .` plus focused smoke if added |
| GH-C05 | regression | Create the first `regression/` case for a previously observed control-plane stall, such as external-evidence waits, P0-blocked/P1 fallback, compact blocker writeback, or no-progress self-repair. | Focused regression command plus `python3 -m py_compile loopx/*.py` |
| GH-C06 | cli | Continue CLI modularization after `ml_experiment`: migrate one more low-risk command group into `loopx/cli_commands/`, keep old invocations working, and extend `regression/cli-command-module-contract.py` if the seam changes. | Command-specific smoke plus `python3 regression/cli-command-module-contract.py` and `python3 -m py_compile loopx/*.py` |
| GH-C08 | status | Improve agent todo projection so `status` / `quota should-run` can expose a broader priority-sorted backlog without letting monitor items hide executable work. | `loopx --format json status` fixture or focused smoke |
| GH-C14 | protocol | Add a focused regression for protocol action packet output so future Codex CLI wrappers cannot accidentally invoke model APIs or runner adapters from the decision-only path. | `python3 examples/protocol/protocol-action-packet-smoke.py` or new focused smoke |
| GH-C22 | benchmark | Add launch artifact observable handles: pid/process state, job basename, compact artifact refs, allowed poll command, and read-boundary flags so heartbeat observation does not depend on chat memory. | Focused fake launch artifact smoke |
| GH-C40 | benchmark | Extend the benchmark developer workflow product path after the ECS tooling landed: add ALE compact readiness/blocker commands, document Terminal-Bench ECS launch hygiene plus the canonical Codex Goal / SkillsBench route, and deepen no-upload reducer, preflight, and app-goal setup-tail docs so contributors can distinguish launch-ready cases from verifier-bootstrap or setup blockers without launching private benchmark jobs or copying raw artifacts. | `python3 examples/benchmark-developer-workflow-doc-smoke.py`, `python3 examples/benchmark-ecs-developer-tooling-smoke.py`, and a new focused smoke if code is added |
| GH-C41 | benchmark | Add an explicit benchmark route label/policy that separates `cloud_codex_default`, `split_control_fallback`, and `upstream_adapter_branch`, so legacy bridge probes and benchmark-fork patches cannot be mistaken for clean product-path evidence. | Policy fixture plus `python3 examples/benchmark-developer-workflow-doc-smoke.py` |
| GH-C42 | benchmark | Retire split-control from the main benchmark attention path after the first cloud-host smoke succeeds or reaches a concrete gate: keep durable contracts/reducers, move new local-Codex/remote-executor experiments to a labeled experimental branch, and delete or defer bridge code that the cloud route no longer needs. | Inventory note plus `python3 examples/benchmark-developer-workflow-doc-smoke.py` |
| GH-C28 | planning | Implement local-only dry-run proposal generation for dreaming: read public-safe run history/project state and emit proposal records without mutating project truth. | Dry-run smoke with fake project state |
| GH-C43 | showcase | Turn the shipped auto-research worker-loop and visible supervisor path into a contributor-safe operator walkthrough or showcase fixture under `docs/product/` or `docs/showcases/`, using only synthetic/redacted lane state, artifacts, takeover gates, and visible-goal startup steps that match the current Codex CLI flow. | `python3 examples/showcase-catalog-smoke.py`, `python3 examples/auto-research-worker-loop-smoke.py`, and `loopx check --scan-path docs/product --scan-path docs/showcases` |
| GH-C44 | dashboard | Defer auto-research-specific dashboard work until the generic multi-agent runner has a stable operator projection. Any future surface should consume compact runner/tick/evidence state, not a bespoke auto-research display packet. | `loopx check --scan-path docs/product --scan-path docs/status-data-contract.md --scan-path docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md`; dashboard fixture if added |
| GH-C45 | coordination | Add a claim-aware selection regression for side agents after the `workspace_guard` projection copy: side agents should see why a primary-owned todo is skipped, preserve the current agent lane during autonomous replan, then pick an in-scope unclaimed/side-agent todo or create a primary review successor. | Focused smoke around `workspace_guard`, `claimed_by`, agent-lane preservation, side-agent identity, and handoff surfaces |
| GH-C49 | dashboard | Polish the shipped `/frontstage` goal-channel board: improve visual acceptance coverage, local demo fixture clarity, and operator onboarding affordances while keeping `attention_queue.items[].goal_channel_projection` read-only browser data and making agent-lane/workspace-guard states legible. | `npm run smoke:frontstage-route`, `npm run smoke:frontstage-browser`, and `loopx check --scan-path apps/presentation/dashboard --scan-path docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md` |
| GH-C50 | control plane | Implement the first generic `observable_artifact_handle_v0` slice from `docs/product/domain-capability-packs.md`: compact handle, allowed poll command, artifact refs, terminal markers, and read-boundary flags for long-running work without assuming a benchmark, CI, deployment, or ML experiment adapter. | Focused fixture smoke plus `loopx check --scan-path docs/product/domain-capability-packs.md --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C55 | dashboard | Claimed by Zayn Jarvis (`ZaynJarvis`), who authored the Lark Kanban adapter PR: explore a thin local multi-agent workflow launcher PoC. Define the smallest user-facing flow for discovering configured local agents, assigning workflow roles, launching them from LoopX, and showing each agent's status/evidence in the management surface. Keep this as a local-first launcher UX slice; do not introduce a full server/daemon architecture in the first PR. | Dashboard fixture or Storybook-style fixture if added, `npm run smoke:frontstage-route`, `npm run smoke:frontstage-browser`, and `loopx check --scan-path apps/presentation/dashboard --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C56 | workflow | Design the first default workflow planner for development-host LoopX usage: model visible TUI, headless runtime, IM/gateway intake, shell/service timer, and hybrid handoff as peer modes, then generate the right scoped workflow from user intent and host capabilities. The planner should cover agent identity, heartbeat/monitor guard, no-spend quiet skip, readiness verification, and explicit transitions such as visible bootstrap -> headless continuation or headless event -> visible TUI escalation. Keep it adapter-neutral and public-safe; do not bake in one chat platform, private host, or project layout. | Design note or fixture plus `loopx check --scan-path docs/ --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md`; if code is added, include a focused smoke proving the generated workflow carries `--agent-id`, preserves no-spend monitor behavior, and distinguishes TUI, headless, IM/gateway, shell/service, and hybrid runtime choices |
| GH-C60 | workflow | Add focused smoke coverage for the runtime connector catalog rows: Codex App heartbeat, Codex CLI TUI, Claude Code loop, shell worker, HTTP webhook, and worker bridge. Keep the tests adapter-neutral and assert scoped identity, scheduler hints, no-spend cadence/final-check behavior, `workspace_guard` / `agent_scope_wait` repair paths, and private-boundary stripping. | Focused smoke(s) plus `loopx check --scan-path docs/runtime-connector-catalog.md --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C59 | status | Add a focused hot-path perf smoke for large ignored state trees and a bounded cold-path todo detail contract so `status` / `quota` stay fast without dropping public-safe backlog drill-down. | Focused perf/fixture smoke plus `loopx check --scan-path docs/status-data-contract.md --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C61 | cli | Implement the next canonical global manager command after `/loopx-global-summary`: choose one of `/loopx-global-gates`, `/loopx-global-todos`, `/loopx-global-risks`, or `/loop-goal-summary`, keep it read-only, source it from compact status/quota/todo/run-history projections, and make unknown aliases fail closed with help instead of broad dumps. | Focused command smoke plus `python3 examples/project/global-manager-command-protocol-smoke.py` and `loopx check --scan-path docs/reference/protocols/global-manager-command-v0.md --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C62 | governance | Add a visible governance/budget projection slice: show per-goal or per-agent owner, claim, quota state, scheduler hint, approval requirement, and allowed next action in a compact operator-facing shape. Do not add a browser write API; map pause/override/terminate proposals back to gates or dry-run actions. | Focused fixture smoke plus `loopx check --scan-path docs/status-data-contract.md --scan-path docs/interface-budget-contract.md --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C63 | value connectors | Implement the first dry-run-only `finance_market_snapshot` canary from `docs/capabilities/value-connectors/finance-market-snapshot-probe.md`: tiny symbol allowlist, public Eastmoney quote endpoint, compact field allowlist, `source_unverified` labels, and no raw provider payload retention. It must fail closed for Futu/OpenD, account, private portfolio, paid data, trading, captcha, and credential paths. | `python3 examples/value-connectors-finance-probe-doc-smoke.py`, a new focused canary smoke if code is added, and `loopx check --scan-path docs/capabilities/value-connectors --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |

### Advanced Implementation

Shared-state, adapter, or benchmark-control changes. Please open an issue first
and keep the first PR as a narrow slice.

| ID | Area | Task | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GH-C07 | state | Add structured-state write serialization for todo/refresh/history writers using a per-goal lock or optimistic revision guard. Include a concurrent todo add/update regression. | New concurrency regression plus `python3 -m py_compile loopx/*.py` |
| GH-C15 | benchmark | Implement benchmark ledger drift warning: when compact run history has a benchmark result but `benchmark-run-ledger.json/md` lacks the row, status should warn or closeout should auto-upsert. Keep raw task/log/trajectory material out. | `python3 examples/benchmark-run-ledger-smoke.py` |
| GH-C16 | benchmark | Add a public-safe trajectory-summary contract for non-SkillsBench adapters so Terminal-Bench/SWE/ALE can expose comparable counters without raw task text, logs, verifier output, or trajectory bodies. | New unit/fake fixture smoke |
| GH-C46 | coordination | Implement the `agent_profile_v0` contract from `docs/product/agent-profile-contract.md`: registry validation, `heartbeat-prompt --agent-id` profile resolution without repeated `--agent-scope`, and read-only `agent_member_v0` status/review projection. | Configure/heartbeat prompt smokes, status/review projection smoke, plus `python3 -m py_compile loopx/*.py` |
| GH-C47 | state | Promote soft todo claims toward `task_lease_v0`: per-`(goal_id, todo_id)` lease key, TTL, idempotency key, write-scope conflict policy, renew/transfer semantics, and status/quota projection. | Concurrent todo/lease smoke plus `python3 -m py_compile loopx/*.py` |

### Design / RFC

Direction-setting work. These tasks should usually produce a doc or issue
before implementation.

| ID | Area | Task | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GH-C25 | server | Implement the first server-roadmap slice from `docs/architecture.md`: file-backed per-goal writer serialization plus idempotency keys for one narrow write path, with CLI-only fallback preserved. | Concurrency regression plus `python3 -m py_compile loopx/*.py` |
| GH-C32 | learning | Implement the first read-only reward-style hint preview from `docs/product/reward-style-replanning.md`: derive compact candidate-ranking hints from public-safe reward/todo evidence without writing durable hints yet. | Preview smoke proving hints can reorder safe candidates but cannot override user gates, claims, scopes, capability gates, or workspace guards |
| GH-C33 | resource sync | After server/daemon design lands, define periodic Resource-to-Todo sync as a planning-queue producer: compare repo docs, roadmap/status contracts, and authority commitments against active todos, then propose updates through structured lifecycle APIs before promotion. | Design note; implementation blocked on server lane |
| GH-C35 | integration | Design a session-runtime control-plane adapter: read compact session/event/outcome/approval summaries from an external agent host, project LoopX attention items, and keep raw transcripts, credentials, billing, permissions, and product frontstage outside LoopX. | Design note with adapter-neutral smoke plan |
| GH-C37 | interaction model | Curate the interaction pattern catalog with one new public-safe good/bad case, including trigger signals, user channel, agent channel, state contract, bad smell, and validation reference. Do not copy raw chat, private benchmark artifacts, or internal links. | `loopx check --scan-path docs/interaction-pattern-catalog.md` |
| GH-C39 | interaction model | Design explicit `decision_scope` / `required_decision_scopes` metadata for user gates and agent todos so scoped fallback does not rely on prompt memory or text inference. | RFC update to `docs/interaction-pattern-catalog.md` plus one projection fixture |
| GH-C48 | product | Design the creator-ops fake-data demo storyboard: trend discovery -> preference map -> insight board -> draft queue -> material library -> human feedback -> controlled replan. Use synthetic/public-safe data only. | Storyboard doc under `docs/product/` or `docs/showcases/` plus `loopx check --scan-path docs/product --scan-path docs/showcases` |
| GH-C54 | policy | Define the creator-ops feedback and boundary contract: how non-technical user feedback becomes gates, preferences, todo updates, or product-improvement notes while preserving source attribution, platform terms, no-autopublish gates, and private creative-material boundaries. | Contract/RFC under `docs/product/` plus `loopx check --scan-path docs/product --scan-path docs/public-private-boundary.md` |
| GH-C51 | capability packs | Design `domain_pack_contract_v0` and suggest-only `domain_pack_detection_v0`: packs default off, detection recommends enablement without writing domain conclusions, and first enablement requires registry or owner authority. | RFC update plus `loopx check --scan-path docs/product/domain-capability-packs.md --scan-path CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md` |
| GH-C52 | ML experiment pack | Draft the read-only/advisory `ml_experiment` pack contract: `ml_experiment_result_v0`, `dataset_window_contract_v0`, `hypothesis_ledger_v0`, and `experiment_replan_preview`, with launch/stop/restart explicitly excluded until delivery mode is authorized. | Design note or fixture under `docs/product/` or `docs/reference/protocols/` plus public/private scan |

### Maintainer-Owned / Coordination Required

Visible work that should not be duplicated. Ask for a public helper slice
instead of launching private runs or broad product changes.

| ID | Area | Task | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GH-C18 | benchmark | Long-horizon benchmark evidence program, including live local no-upload cases, runner contracts, trace retention, score accounting, and good/bad case attribution. Do not duplicate live runs or inspect private artifacts unless maintainers split out a public helper issue. | Maintainer-run benchmark ledger and public/private scan |
| GH-C19 | benchmark | Main-table SkillsBench product-mode comparison: raw Codex autonomous max5 versus LoopX state/todo/replan/CLI, no verifier feedback to either arm, stop on reward 1 or declared done. This lane remains maintainer-owned while goal-start verifier/bootstrap preflight is still being repaired. External contributors can help with schema/docs/smokes only. | Maintainer-run compact ledger, case-analysis update, and public verifier-bootstrap scan |

## Projection Sources

This board is maintained from public-safe projections of:

- the local `loopx-meta` Agent Todo list;
- public docs under `docs/`, especially the state interaction model, status
  data contract, quota allocation, integration guide, product vision, and
  benchmark research docs;
- recent maintainer review of which work is externally claimable versus
  maintainer-owned live automation.

Projection rules:

- copy the task intent, not private evidence details;
- convert private benchmark runs into public helper slices unless maintainers
  explicitly publish a runnable issue;
- mark live benchmark, release, and automation lanes as `Maintainer-owned`
  when duplicate work would waste compute or weaken evidence;
- prefer tasks that name likely files and validation, so contributors can start
  without reading local active state.

## Suggested Labels

Use these labels on GitHub issues when possible:

- `good first issue`: small, well-scoped, low setup, with files and validation
  called out.
- `help wanted`: useful public task where the approach is clear enough for an
  external contributor.
- `claimed`: someone is actively working on the issue.
- `maintainer-owned`: visible work that should not be duplicated.
- `needs design`: implementation is not ready until the design is agreed.
- `blocked`: waiting on a decision, dependency, or maintainer action.
- Area labels such as `area: docs`, `area: cli`, `area: status`,
  `area: benchmark`, `area: dashboard`, and `area: tests`.

## Maintainer Update Rules

- Keep this board curated. If it grows beyond roughly 35 open rows, move older
  or lower-priority work into GitHub issues and keep only the best entry points
  here.
- Every public task should include a scope, expected validation, and owner
  state.
- Do not publish private/local state. Summarize it into a public task only when
  the work is safe for the repository.
- After a meaningful internal milestone, update this board manually if there is
  a new contributor-sized slice.
- Remove or refresh stale tasks instead of leaving obsolete "good first issue"
  entries in place.
