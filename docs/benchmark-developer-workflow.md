# Benchmark Developer Workflow

Goal Harness treats benchmark execution as a developer workflow, not only as a
research activity. A benchmark runner should be something a contributor can
inspect, dry-run, diagnose, and improve without reading maintainer `.local`
state or raw benchmark trajectories.

This document is the stable product entry point for benchmark work. Research
packets and dated route notes still live under
`docs/research/long-horizon-agent-benchmarks/`, but reusable runner behavior
belongs in `goal_harness/`, `examples/`, and this guide.

## Product Shape

The benchmark workflow has four layers:

1. **Select** a benchmark family, task, and arm without exposing private task
   text or reward leakage.
2. **Launch** through an explicit route contract: local agent, local Goal
   Harness state, and a local model invocation boundary; optional remote
   execution substrate for Docker, runner dependencies, task data, and compact
   reduction.
3. **Observe** the run through compact handles: pid or job state, readiness
   re-check, materialization, result or blocker, and cleanup state.
4. **Ingest** only public-safe evidence into Goal Harness history, ledger, and
   case analysis.

The user-facing product promise is simple: a developer should be able to tell
what ran, why it was allowed, what blocked it, and what can be tried next,
without seeing credentials, raw logs, raw trajectories, or local machine paths.

## Golden Path

From a fresh checkout:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile goal_harness/*.py goal_harness/benchmark_core/*.py
python3 examples/benchmark-split-control-remote-executor-smoke.py
goal-harness benchmark --help
```

For a real benchmark slice, use this sequence:

1. Run a source and boundary preflight for the target benchmark.
2. Build or inspect the split-control readiness payload.
3. Produce a launch plan or runner batch only after a fresh readiness re-check.
4. Build benchmark-specific command-adapter facts, such as
   `goal-harness benchmark terminal-bench-command-adapter terminal-bench`.
   When Terminal-Bench uses a remote executor, first reduce the local-driver
   request plus private remote launch result through the launch adapter:
   `goal-harness benchmark terminal-bench-remote-launch-adapter terminal-bench --request-json <private-json> --launch-result-json <private-json>`.
   The launch adapter emits only field presence and compact blocker state; it
   never executes SSH, Docker, Codex, model calls, uploads, or submits. If a
   lower-level private runner already produced remote-executor handles, reduce
   them through a materializer such as
   `goal-harness benchmark terminal-bench-remote-materializer terminal-bench --handle-manifest-json <private-json>`.
   The materializer emits only handle field presence, never handle values. For
   Terminal-Bench, handle presence is still not enough: the payload must prove
   that a local Codex driver owns agent/model/auth and that the remote executor
   does not require agent or Codex runtime. Then build the execution seam from
   those facts. The seam should expose both a `local_driver_contract` and a
   `remote_sandbox_contract`; treat missing command adapters, missing
   launch-adapter results, missing local-driver materializers, missing sandbox
   contracts, remote-agent-runtime requirements, or compact reducers as
   blockers instead of launching a private script.
5. Run the smallest no-upload dry-run or mini-pair that can answer the current
   product question.
6. Ingest a compact result or precise blocker.
7. Update Goal Harness todo/state so the next developer sees the current route.

Do not start from a raw shell command hidden in a local note. If a benchmark
cannot be launched through a documented route, the next product task is to
build that route, not to keep a one-off script alive.

## Capture The Process While Running

Do not wait for a benchmark family to be fully solved before documenting how it
runs. Each real run should improve the developer workflow in the same batch as
the result or blocker:

1. Before launch, write down the intended route, boundary, command shape,
   expected compact artifacts, and stop conditions.
2. During launch, preserve only observable handles that another developer can
   use: pid or job basename, readiness state, poll command, cleanup state, and
   compact artifact refs.
3. After launch, update the workflow or adapter notes with what changed:
   product-path pass, precise blocker, cleanup rule, or stale assumption.
4. If the run required a private local script, turn the reusable part into a
   public command, fixture, or adapter contract before relying on it again.

The goal is a living runner guide. Repeated benchmark attempts should make the
next attempt easier to launch and debug, not only add more private evidence.

## Split-Control Route

Docker-heavy benchmarks should use the split-control route unless a narrower
local-only route is explicitly safer:

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Local agent | Codex CLI, auth, model invocation, planning, patch generation, Goal Harness state, quota, todo, and evidence filtering. |
| Remote executor | Docker runtime, runner dependencies, task-data or image staging, bounded command/file execution, and compact result reduction. |

The remote executor is not an agent-auth environment. Missing remote Codex,
Codex ACP, or model credentials is not a benchmark blocker. Real blockers are
things like missing split-control adapter, missing runner tooling, missing task
data or images, missing remote node runtime when a specific runner requires it,
or a failed cleanup/readiness check.

An all-remote runner may be useful as an experimental fallback when an
exclusive machine is available and the split-control seam is repeatedly the
only thing blocking benchmark insight. Label those results as
`all_remote_experimental`, keep credentials off shared machines, and do not use
them as product-path evidence for the local-agent / remote-executor control
plane. The product-path target remains: local Codex owns auth, model calls,
state, and writeback; the remote side owns Docker, runner tooling, task
staging, bounded command/file execution, and compact reduction.

See
[`benchmark-split-control-remote-executor-v0.md`](research/long-horizon-agent-benchmarks/benchmark-split-control-remote-executor-v0.md)
for the current machine contract.

## Current Benchmark Families

| Family | Product-path target | Current maturity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Terminal-Bench | Local Codex/Goal Harness controls the attempt; remote executor provides Docker or runner substrate and compact result ingestion. | Has public adapter facts, compact reducers, a remote-executor materializer contract, and an explicit local-driver / remote-sandbox seam contract. Current blocker is wiring that seam to one real no-upload dry-run or exact compact blocker. A direct Harbor/remote-Docker path that requires agent or Codex runtime inside the remote worker is not product-path evidence. |
| SkillsBench | Local Codex/Goal Harness controls state, prompt, and writeback; remote executor stages task files and runs Docker-bound worker surfaces. | Has a local ACP stdio relay probe plus a BenchFlow `ACPClient` host-local transport probe, both dry-run and public-safe. Current launch blocker is the bounded remote command/file bridge; until it exists, a successful relay/transport probe is not mini-pair readiness. |
| Agents' Last Exam | Local Codex/Goal Harness controls the agent; remote Docker/CUA provides the sandbox; compact result or blocker is ingested locally. | A demo/tool-smoke style split-control surface is product-path proven; formal task runs still need task-data and public-claim gates. |

This table is intentionally about runner maturity, not leaderboard score.
Score claims require separate public-safe result ingestion and review.

### SkillsBench Local ACP Preflight

SkillsBench currently uses BenchFlow's ACP stdio worker protocol for Codex-like
agents. For Goal Harness product-mode runs, Codex auth, model invocation, and
goal state must stay local. Before launching a mini-pair, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/skillsbench_automation_loop.py \
  --local-driver-worker-handshake-preflight \
  --local-codex-cli-participant-ready \
  --local-acp-relay-probe \
  --host-local-acp-transport-probe
```

The preflight is successful only when BenchFlow is importable, the default
Codex agent is registered as ACP, the local Codex CLI participant was already
materialized, the local ACP relay completes `initialize`, `session/new`,
`session/set_model`, and `session/prompt`, BenchFlow's own `ACPClient` can
drive that relay over host-local stdio, and a bounded remote command/file
bridge exists for the sandbox side. The default relay and transport probes are
dry-run: they do not invoke Codex, read task text, copy credentials, record raw
logs, or launch a benchmark task.

Do not treat a successful relay probe as mini-pair readiness. It only proves
the local ACP server shape. The host-local transport probe proves BenchFlow can
talk to that local server without `ContainerTransport`. A no-upload mini-pair
is product-path evidence only after the remote bridge is also materialized, so
the preflight may legitimately return `skillsbench_remote_command_file_bridge_missing`
after both local probes pass.

## Evidence Contract

Benchmark evidence may include:

- benchmark id, task id or public-safe case id;
- arm or mode label;
- readiness gate result;
- process or job handle basename;
- compact result fields such as `score`, `best_score`, `final_score`,
  `first_success_round`, `duration_s`, and `blocker`;
- cleanup state;
- links to public docs or compact JSON/Markdown artifacts.

Benchmark evidence must not include:

- raw task text, hidden task files, verifier body output, or solution material;
- raw trajectories, transcripts, screenshots, stdout, stderr, or shell argv;
- credentials, tokens, local absolute paths, remote absolute paths, or private
  hostnames;
- uploads, submit paths, or leaderboard claims unless a specific public release
  gate has approved them.

## Developer Checklist

Before a PR that changes benchmark behavior:

- Name which layer changed: selection, launch, observe, ingest, scoring, or
  docs.
- Keep benchmark-specific runner details inside the adapter.
- Preserve the split-control boundary when a remote executor is involved.
- Add or update a focused smoke for the durable contract.
- Run `goal-harness check --scan-path <changed-public-path>` for public docs or
  examples.
- Do not commit `.local`, raw logs, private run directories, active state, or
  local runner configs.

## Roadmap

Near-term work should make the benchmark workflow feel like a small product:

- expose a single developer-facing command path for readiness and runner batch
  planning;
- add observable launch handles so long runs can be polled without chat memory;
- align Terminal-Bench, SkillsBench, and Agents' Last Exam on the same
  launch/observe/ingest lifecycle;
- document the no-upload dry-run path before chasing broad score matrices;
- make compact blockers first-class, so a failed launch still teaches the next
  developer exactly what to repair.
