# Interaction Pattern Catalog

LoopX has accumulated many user / agent / state interaction lessons.
The state interaction model explains the architecture; this catalog records the
repeatable situations we want every controller, heartbeat, dashboard, and
benchmark runner to handle the same way.

Use this document when a good case, bad case, incident, or product insight
reveals a reusable interaction shape. Each pattern should be specific enough to
drive implementation, tests, and dashboard copy without requiring future agents
to mine chat history.

## Pattern Template

Each pattern should answer:

- **Trigger**: which status, quota, todo, run-history, or boundary signals make
  the pattern active;
- **Importance**: `P0` for hot-path behaviors that can block or misroute a
  controller turn, `P1` for durable operational behaviors, and `P2` for
  specialized or experiment-specific behaviors;
- **User channel**: whether the user must be interrupted, only notified, or not
  contacted;
- **Agent channel**: what Codex must do, may do, or must not do;
- **State contract**: durable fields that prove the pattern is represented;
- **Bad smell**: how the system usually fails when the pattern is missing;
- **Visual model**: one Mermaid diagram, state table, or decision tree that can
  be used in product explanation;
- **Validation**: smoke, fixture, or doc check that protects the behavior.

Keep examples public-safe. Do not copy raw benchmark tasks, raw trajectories,
private logs, verifier output tails, credentials, internal URLs, or local
machine paths.

## Decision Scope Model

User gates are not global booleans. The first-class model is a scoped decision:
the machine-facing schema is
[`decision_scope_v0`](reference/protocols/decision-scope-v0.md).

- a **decision/gate** names the authority still needed, such as a private
  material read, resource spend, write boundary, production action, public
  submission, or product-direction choice;
- an **agent action** names the authority it depends on and the effect it will
  produce, such as read-only analysis, local code edit, external run, private
  source sync, or dashboard write;
- the controller compares the two as a scope relation:
  `gate covers action`, `gate does not cover action`, or `scope is ambiguous`.

This keeps the product behavior simple:

| Relation | User Channel | Agent Channel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gate covers selected action and no independent fallback exists | ask concrete user todo | stop gated delivery; no spend |
| gate covers selected action but an independent fallback exists | notify concrete user todo | execute fallback, validate, write back, spend once |
| gate does not cover selected action | keep gate visible if useful | execute selected action normally |
| scope is ambiguous | ask/repair projection | do not infer permission from prose |

The durable target schema should make this relation explicit rather than
relying on prompt memory or text matching:

```text
user_todo.decision_scope = {
  kind: private_read | write_scope | resource | production | public_claim | direction,
  granularity: action | lane | goal | project | global,
  scope_key: "...",
  expires_at?: "..."
}

agent_todo.required_decision_scopes[] = [...]
agent_todo.required_write_scopes[] = [...]
agent_todo.safety_class = read_only | local_write | external_run | protected_write
```

Compatibility inference from `action_kind`, title, or text is allowed only as a
transition layer. If explicit scope is missing and inference is not confident,
the correct behavior is projection repair or a user/controller gate, not a
silent fallback.

Markdown text inference is a lint, not the gate truth. In the hot path,
`quota should-run` should prefer structured fields such as `task_class`,
`decision_scope`, `required_decision_scopes`, `safety_class`,
`user_todo_summary`, and `interaction_contract`. Free-text parsing of
`Next Action` exists only to catch legacy states where a human-readable wait or
executable action was never projected into a todo. It must not override a
current `interaction_contract.user_channel.action_required=false` plus an open
agent todo. LLM-assisted interpretation belongs in a cold-path proposal or
authoring helper; it may suggest converting prose into a structured todo, but
must not decide delivery gates, spend policy, or write permission directly.

## Pattern Families

Use families as the first routing layer. They keep the catalog readable as the
number of patterns grows, and they make it easier for skills, dashboards, and
benchmark reviews to ask for "the relevant interaction family" instead of
scanning every IP.

| Family | Purpose | Start Here When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Work Routing | Decide whether the agent should deliver, fallback, recover, or stay quiet. | quota/status says work may run, but the next action is blocked, monitor-only, or outcome-thin |
| Human Decision | Represent user, owner, simulator, reward, and approval moments without hiding the exact ask. | a user action, correction, approval, or run-bound judgment changes what the agent should do |
| State And Boundary | Keep compact control-plane truth aligned with todos, scopes, leases, authority, and write boundaries. | state says one thing but todos, permissions, or authority sources imply another |
| Evidence Lifecycle | Make external evidence and benchmark work countable without copying raw logs or task data. | a benchmark, CI, model run, or external handle must advance through observable lifecycle states |
| Planning Governance | Control replanning, dreaming, cadence, and future-work writeback without turning chat into state. | the agent is planning, widening work, proposing future routes, or publishing top todos |

## Catalog

Catalog rows are grouped by family and sorted by importance inside each family.
`P0` means hot-path behavior that can block or misroute a controller turn;
`P1` means durable operational behavior that should be preserved once the hot
path is healthy; `P2` means specialized or experiment-specific behavior.
IP IDs remain stable even when display order changes.

### Work Routing

Hot-path execution decisions: deliver, fallback, recover, or stay quiet.

| Importance | ID | Name | Primary Owner | User Channel | Agent Channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | IP-001 | Bounded Delivery | Agent | no interruption | implement, validate, write back, spend once |
| P0 | IP-002 | Blocked Priority With Safe Fallback | Agent plus user-visible notification | notify without requiring an answer | continue safe fallback after exposing blocked higher-priority work |
| P0 | IP-003 | Scoped Gate With Safe Fallback | User plus agent | notify concrete scoped gate | execute non-dependent fallback; no gated action |
| P0 | IP-021 | Per-Todo Capability Gate | CLI projects, agent decides | ask only when missing capability is owner-held | expose runnable executable candidates; agent chooses one, otherwise repair bridge or skip |
| P0 | IP-007 | Outcome Floor Recovery | Agent | usually no interruption | produce missing outcome-scale evidence or blocker only |
| P1 | IP-008 | Monitor Quiet Skip | CLI/controller | no notification | append at most one no-spend poll, then stay quiet |

### Human Decision

Human asks, approvals, interventions, and reward-derived lessons.

| Importance | ID | Name | Primary Owner | User Channel | Agent Channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | IP-004 | Concrete User Todo Projection | User | ask or notify with concrete todo/question | do not hide behind generic "owner gate" text |
| P0 | IP-014 | Decision Write Preview And Append | User/operator | explicit preview/apply decision | append only exact run-bound reward or gate decision event |
| P1 | IP-017 | User Reward Lesson Promotion | User plus LoopX | acknowledge only when lesson changes route/priority/boundary | promote correction into durable lesson, todo, or projection before continuing |
| P2 | IP-009 | Active User Assistance | User simulator / operator | bounded intervention | inject audited user help without leaking reward/oracle signals |

### State And Boundary

Projection, authority, write scope, and lease integrity.

| Importance | ID | Name | Primary Owner | User Channel | Agent Channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | IP-005 | State Projection Gap | Agent | no user ask unless a user todo is missing | repair todo/state projection before ordinary delivery |
| P0 | IP-006 | Checkpointed Scope Mismatch | CLI/controller | ask or repair boundary projection | do not execute action whose write scope is not projected |
| P0 | IP-026 | Agent-Scoped No-Candidate Gap | Status/quota | no interruption | project scope exhaustion or primary-review wait instead of forcing delivery |
| P1 | IP-011 | Authority Material Intake | Agent plus registry | notify only on gate/conflict | register redacted source contract before relying on material |
| P1 | IP-016 | Task Lease Claim | Controller/agent | no interruption unless conflict requires decision | claim bounded work with TTL, write scope, and conflict policy |
| P1 | IP-019 | Side-Agent Scoped Continuation | Primary plus side agent | no interruption unless scope/review is ambiguous | side agent claims scoped todo, uses independent worktree, then self-merges small validated work or hands review to primary |
| P1 | IP-020 | Todo Claim / Supersede / Successor Lifecycle | Agent plus controller | no interruption unless successor is a user todo or conflict needs decision | claim before delivery; supersede stale work; complete slices with successor or no-follow-up rationale |
| P1 | IP-022 | Claimed Todo Visibility And Agent-Lane Next Action | Status/quota/frontstage | no interruption | keep scheduler candidates separate from claimed-work visibility lanes and expose the current agent's slice |
| P1 | IP-023 | Status Neutral Run Window | Status/quota/history | no interruption | ignore neutral run noise for state authority while retaining it as stall evidence |
| P1 | IP-025 | Experimental Diagnostic Sidecar Boundary | Runtime/protocol owners | no interruption unless an opt-in proof asks for user action | keep proof/debug verdicts as sidecar diagnostics until a product-general schema is validated |

### Evidence Lifecycle

External handles, benchmark transitions, and countable proof.

| Importance | ID | Name | Primary Owner | User Channel | Agent Channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | IP-012 | External Evidence Observation | Agent/controller | no interruption unless handle missing needs owner input | observe compact handles/results; do not launch benchmark/model work |
| P1 | IP-015 | Benchmark Lifecycle Countability | Benchmark adapter/controller | no interruption by default | advance only through compact countable lifecycle gates |

### Planning Governance

Replanning, dreaming, cadence, and future-work writeback.

| Importance | ID | Name | Primary Owner | User Channel | Agent Channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | IP-013 | Autonomous Replan Vs Advisory Dreaming | Agent/controller plus user when promoted | ask only for promotion/decision | repair stalled delivery; keep dreaming proposal non-executable |
| P1 | IP-024 | Repair Delta Contract | Agent/controller | no interruption unless repair creates a user todo | self-repair/replan must change the machine-visible frontier or record a no-op/blocker |
| P1 | IP-010 | Cadence Widening | Agent/controller | no interruption by default | widen next work segment when turns become too small |
| P1 | IP-018 | Plan To Todo Writeback | Agent plus LoopX | no interruption unless a user todo is created | write user-facing plans into todos, Next Action, or refresh-state |

## Visual Model

The catalog should support partner and user-facing explanation, not only
implementation. Keep diagrams public-safe and generic. Prefer diagrams that
show actor boundaries, decision ownership, and fallback behavior without raw
project or benchmark evidence.

The smallest reusable diagram is the user / agent / LoopX routing loop:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Q["quota should-run"] --> C{"interaction_contract.mode"}
  C -->|"bounded_delivery"| A["Agent implements, validates, writes back"]
  C -->|"user_gate"| U["User answers concrete gate"]
  C -->|"monitor_quiet_skip"| M["No-spend liveness poll"]
  C -->|"outcome_floor_recovery"| R["Agent produces missing outcome evidence or blocker"]
  A --> S["refresh-state / history event"]
  U --> S
  R --> S
  S --> Q
```

The blocked-priority fallback pattern deserves its own public demo because it
captures the product taste: do not idle on a gate, and do not hide the gate
while doing fallback work.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant GH as LoopX
  participant Agent as Agent
  participant User as User
  GH->>Agent: P0 blocked, P1 fallback safe
  Agent->>User: Notify concrete P0 blocker
  Agent->>Agent: Execute safe P1/P2 fallback
  Agent->>GH: Validate, write back, spend once
  GH->>User: P0 blocker remains visible
```

Future public surfaces can include:

- static SVG or Mermaid diagrams embedded in README/docs;
- a fake-data dashboard walkthrough for the first three patterns;
- a short animated video showing "P0 gate + safe fallback" with no private
  benchmark artifacts;
- a public demo script that can be narrated to potential collaborators.

## Pattern Details

Pattern details use the same family order as the catalog. Within each
family, P0 patterns come first, followed by P1 and P2 patterns. The IP
number is stable identity, not display priority.

### Work Routing

#### IP-001 Bounded Delivery

**Trigger**

- `quota should-run.should_run=true`;
- `interaction_contract.mode=bounded_delivery`;
- `interaction_contract.agent_channel.must_attempt=true`;
- no private, credential, production, destructive, or unprojected write-scope
  blocker applies.

**Expected behavior**

The agent chooses one bounded segment, performs the work, runs focused
validation, writes durable state or history, and spends exactly once after the
validated delivery.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Q["eligible quota"] --> A["choose bounded segment"]
  A --> D["deliver artifact or blocker"]
  D --> V["focused validation"]
  V --> W["durable writeback"]
  W --> S["spend once"]
```

**Bad smell**

The agent sends a status update after reading only one file, or spends quota
without a validated artifact or blocker.

**Validation**

- `examples/work-lane-contract-smoke.py`
- `examples/heartbeat-quota-flow-smoke.py`
- `loopx check`

#### IP-002 Blocked Priority With Safe Fallback

**Trigger**

- a higher-priority agent todo is blocked;
- a lower-priority todo is executable and safe;
- `blocked_priority_fallback.notify_user=true` or equivalent quota/status
  projection is present;
- user action may be useful, but the selected fallback does not require the
  user answer before proceeding.

**Expected behavior**

The user-facing message must preserve the blocked higher-priority item and the
reason the fallback is being used. The agent may continue the safe fallback, but
must not let the fallback become the main story silently.

Example shape:

```text
Core lane is blocked on <decision/resource>. I will continue <safe fallback>
now, and the pending user todo remains <concrete ask>.
```

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant GH as LoopX
  participant Agent as Agent
  participant User as User
  GH->>Agent: Higher P0 blocked, fallback executable
  Agent->>User: Notify concrete blocked P0
  Agent->>Agent: Execute safe fallback
  Agent->>GH: Write result and keep P0 visible
```

**Bad smell**

The agent either freezes completely on a gate even though other safe work is
available, or silently works on lower-priority items while the user loses sight
of the P0 blocker.

**Validation**

- `examples/todo-first-open-summary-smoke.py`
- `docs/heartbeat-automation-prompt.md`

#### IP-003 Scoped Gate With Safe Fallback

**Trigger**

- an open user todo is a real gate, not just advisory context;
- the gate can be scoped to one selected agent action, lane, resource, or
  boundary;
- another executable agent todo is independent of that gate;
- the fallback remains inside public/private, write-scope, resource, and quota
  boundaries.

**Expected behavior**

The user channel must still notify the concrete gate. The agent channel must
not execute the gated action, but should continue the independent fallback when
quota and safety allow it. This is a dual-channel state, not a contradiction:

```text
user_action_required=true
agent_action_required=true
agent_action=<independent fallback>
```

The controller should expose a durable field such as
`scoped_user_gate_fallback` with:

- the blocked user gate;
- the gated agent item(s);
- the selected fallback;
- a spend policy that permits spending only after validated fallback writeback.

The best long-term implementation is explicit scope metadata:
`user_todo.decision_scope` and `agent_todo.required_decision_scopes`. Runtime
text or `action_kind` inference is only a compatibility bridge for older goal
states.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  G["open user gate"] --> S{"which action scope?"}
  S -->|"covers selected action"| F{"independent fallback exists?"}
  S -->|"ambiguous"| R["repair projection or ask user/controller"]
  F -->|"no"| U["notify user; stop gated delivery"]
  F -->|"yes"| D["notify user and run fallback"]
  D --> V["validate fallback"]
  V --> W["write back; spend once"]
```

**Bad smell**

The payload says `must_attempt_work=true` and `do_not_cancel_on_block=true`,
but `interaction_contract.agent_channel.delivery_allowed=false` only because
`requires_user_action=true`. The agent then repeats the gate forever even
though another safe todo is available.

The opposite bad smell is also dangerous: the agent silently continues work
without naming the blocked user decision, so the fallback becomes the main
story and the human loses the critical gate.

**Validation**

- `regression/scoped-user-gate-fallback-contract.py`
- `examples/protocol-action-packet-smoke.py`
- `examples/work-lane-contract-smoke.py`

#### IP-021 Per-Todo Capability Gate

**Trigger**

- visible executable agent todos declare `required_capabilities`, such as
  `shell`, `filesystem_write`, `benchmark_runner`, `external_evidence_poll`,
  `network`, or `credentials`;
- `quota should-run` has quota to spend, but the current launcher may not have
  every capability required by the highest-priority todo;
- more than one executable todo may be visible, including multiple P0 or
  multiple P1 candidates.

**Expected behavior**

Capability is a per-todo execution preflight, not a global agent profile and
not a permission grant. `status` should project each todo's
`required_capabilities`; `quota should-run` should derive a read-only
`capability_gate` over the visible executable queue.
Do not declare a capability as required merely because the todo is meant to
develop, repair, or parity-check that capability. Use `target_capabilities` for
that output side of the work. For example, a product-path parity todo can
declare `required_capabilities=shell` and `target_capabilities=benchmark_runner`:
the gate may project it as runnable repair work even while the target bridge
capability is absent.

The controller scans executable candidates in projection order and classifies
them, but it does not make the final todo choice. If the first P0 requires
`benchmark_runner` but the second P0 only needs shell/filesystem capability,
both the runnable P0 and any later runnable fallback are projected in
`capability_gate.runnable_candidates`; blocked higher-priority items remain
visible in `capability_gate.blocked_candidates`. `recommended_action` remains
routing context, not a chosen runnable todo.
If the first P0 is not trying to run the benchmark but to repair or materialize
the benchmark bridge itself, it should appear in `runnable_candidates` with
`target_capabilities`, `capability_repair_mode=true`, and
`capability_action=repair_bridge` instead of being hidden behind a lower-value
fallback.

When `capability_gate.action=run`, the decision contract is:

- `decision_owner=agent`;
- `selection_policy=agent_steering_audit_over_runnable_candidates`;
- `runnable_candidates` is the allowed candidate set for this turn;
- candidates with `capability_repair_mode=true` are allowed repair/development
  work for a missing `target_capabilities` bridge, not direct execution through
  that missing bridge;
- `blocked_candidates` is the visible set of higher- or same-priority work
  that cannot currently run;
- the agent must choose the actual todo from `runnable_candidates`, then
  validate and write back that chosen work.

If no visible executable todo can run, the gate chooses:

- `repair_bridge` for local bridge gaps such as `benchmark_runner`,
  `external_evidence_poll`, `worker_bridge`, or `cli_bridge`;
- `ask_owner` for owner-held capabilities such as `network`, `credentials`, or
  `production_access`;
- `skip` when the missing capability is unsupported and no safe repair or owner
  action is known.

Launchers that really have an extra capability should pass it to both
`quota should-run` and `quota spend-slot` with `--available-capability`, so the
preflight and accounting phases agree.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Q["quota should-run"] --> E["visible executable todo queue"]
  E --> C{"candidate required_capabilities satisfied?"}
  C -->|"yes"| R["add to runnable_candidates"]
  C -->|"no, more candidates"| B["add to blocked_candidates"]
  B --> E
  C -->|"no candidates runnable"| M{"missing capability class"}
  M -->|"bridge"| P["repair_bridge"]
  M -->|"owner-held"| U["ask_owner with concrete capability ask"]
  M -->|"unsupported"| S["skip without spend"]
  R --> A["agent steering audit chooses one runnable todo"]
  A --> V["validate chosen work"]
  V --> W["write back and spend-slot with same available capabilities"]
```

**Bad smell**

The system treats quota eligibility as proof that the nearest todo can run,
then repeatedly fails on missing benchmark/network/tooling capability. The
opposite bad smell is over-blocking: one P0 needs a missing runner, but another
P0 or P1 is runnable and safe; the controller freezes instead of projecting the
runnable set for the agent to choose from.

**Validation**

- `docs/quota-allocation.md`
- `examples/capability-gate-smoke.py`
- `examples/todo-cli-smoke.py`

#### IP-007 Outcome Floor Recovery

**Trigger**

- repeated surface-only work has crossed the outcome floor;
- `safe_bypass_kind=outcome_floor_recovery` or
  `heartbeat_recommendation.recommended_mode=outcome_floor_recovery`;
- quota exposes a concrete `must_advance` target.

**Expected behavior**

The agent may do only the bounded recovery: produce the missing evidence named
by `must_advance`, or write the blocker explaining why that evidence cannot be
produced. Ordinary docs/status propagation should wait.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  F["outcome floor crossed"] --> T["read must_advance"]
  T --> E{"can produce outcome evidence?"}
  E -->|"yes"| P["produce evidence"]
  E -->|"no"| B["write concrete blocker"]
  P --> V["validate and spend once"]
  B --> V
```

**Bad smell**

The system keeps improving wrappers, summaries, or queues while never producing
the evidence needed to decide whether the goal is working.

**Validation**

- `docs/archive/incidents/outcome-floor-safe-bypass-incident-20260606.md`
- `examples/quota-plan-smoke.py`
- `examples/upgrade-plan-smoke.py`

#### IP-008 Monitor Quiet Skip

**Trigger**

- `should_run=false`;
- `effective_action=monitor_quiet_skip`;
- no user gate, user todo blocker, external handle observation, or self-repair
  obligation is active.

**Expected behavior**

The agent may append at most one no-spend monitor poll, rerun the guard, and
then stay quiet. The automation remains alive; monitor-only quiet skips are not
completion or deletion signals.

Status and diagnose should display unchanged monitor-only work as
`waiting_on=monitor_signal` with `severity=watch`, while retaining the quota
decision `effective_action=monitor_quiet_skip`. This keeps the monitor visible
without making it look like immediate Codex work or a user/controller gate.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  N["should_run=false"] --> M{"monitor_quiet_skip and no gate?"}
  M -->|"no"| C["follow concrete contract"]
  M -->|"yes"| P["append no-spend poll"]
  P --> R["rerun quota guard"]
  R --> Q["quiet; keep automation active"]
```

**Bad smell**

The heartbeat stops itself because nothing changed, or spends quota on a
no-op status repetition. Another failure mode is presenting monitor-only work
as an immediate Codex action; the agent then keeps trying to deliver from a
watch lane instead of staying quiet or writing a concrete blocker.

- `docs/archive/incidents/monitor-only-replan-stall-incident-20260621.md`

### Human Decision

#### IP-004 Concrete User Todo Projection

**Trigger**

- `interaction_contract.user_channel.action_required=true`; or
- `user_todo_summary.open_count > 0`.

**Expected behavior**

The heartbeat, status, dashboard, or review packet must name the concrete user
todo/question. It must not say only "owner gate" or "waiting on user". If the
payload says user action is required but no concrete todo/question is projected,
the correct message is a state projection bug:

```text
specific user todo is not projected; repair LoopX state projection
```

When `action_required=false` and `user_todo_summary.open_count=0`, the system
may say there is no user todo and should not imply a projection fault.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  U{"user action required or user_open > 0?"}
  U -->|"yes"| C{"concrete todo/question projected?"}
  C -->|"yes"| A["ask or notify with concrete item"]
  C -->|"no"| R["report projection repair needed"]
  U -->|"no"| N["no user todo / no notification"]
```

**Bad smell**

The user sees repeated vague gate messages and cannot tell what decision is
needed.

**Validation**

- `docs/heartbeat-automation-prompt.md`
- `examples/quota-plan-smoke.py`
- `examples/heartbeat-quota-flow-smoke.py`

#### IP-014 Decision Write Preview And Append

**Trigger**

- the operator is recording a run-bound `human_reward`; or
- the operator/controller is recording an `operator_gate` decision;
- a dashboard or loopback server wants to write a decision event rather than
  only render status.

**Expected behavior**

Decision writes must be exact-target, compact, previewed when browser-originated,
and append-only. `human_reward` attaches to one selected run row. `operator_gate`
records a decision run and, for approvals, a resume contract that forces the
receiving agent to re-read current registry, active state, quota, repo status,
policy, and run state before executing.

Browser reward append requires an explicit local capability, loopback origin,
matching `preview_id`, unchanged selected run, unchanged payload, unchanged raw
index count, public-safe text, and exactly one overlay append. Dashboard gate
append remains disabled until a separate equivalent handshake exists.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User as Operator
  participant UI as Dashboard/CLI
  participant GH as LoopX
  User->>UI: Select exact run or gate
  UI->>GH: Preview compact decision
  GH->>UI: public-safe preview_id / dry-run result
  User->>UI: Confirm append
  UI->>GH: Apply exact preview
  GH->>GH: Reject stale/private/mismatched writes
  GH->>GH: Append one decision event
  GH->>UI: Refresh compact status
```

**Bad smell**

The dashboard makes local reward/gate writes feel like ordinary form submission,
or an approved gate is treated as durable write authority without a fresh
decision-point re-read.

**Validation**

- `docs/dashboard-reward-write-boundary.md`
- `examples/reward-gate-direct-write-contract-smoke.py`
- `examples/reward-append-api-smoke.py`
- `examples/dashboard-reward-append-browser-smoke.mjs`
- `examples/operator-gate-resume-contract-smoke.py`

#### IP-017 User Reward Lesson Promotion

**Trigger**

- the user explicitly corrects a product route, priority, benchmark protocol,
  safety boundary, or operating rule;
- the correction supersedes a current todo, `recommended_action`, route
  assumption, or benchmark adapter plan;
- future agents would be likely to repeat the old assumption if the correction
  remains only in chat.

**Expected behavior**

The agent must pause ordinary delivery selection and promote the correction
into durable state before continuing. The minimal durable promotion is one of:

- update active `Next Action` and the relevant open `Agent Todo`;
- append or prepare a run-bound `human_reward` / operating-lesson event;
- add a concrete successor todo for the product/runtime change;
- update this catalog or the self-repair pattern table if the situation is
  reusable.

The correction should record:

- corrected rule;
- scope, such as goal, project, benchmark family, route, or adapter;
- superseded assumption;
- owner of the next implementation step;
- validation that future `quota should-run` or posthoc parity checks can see
  the rule.

This is not the same as hidden model memory. The model may remember the
conversation, but LoopX must expose a replayable hook for future agents.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  U["user correction / reward"] --> S{"does it change route, priority, or policy?"}
  S -->|"no"| C["ordinary chat acknowledgement"]
  S -->|"yes"| P["promote compact lesson"]
  P --> T["update todo / Next Action / reward overlay"]
  T --> Q["refresh-state and rerun quota"]
  Q --> A["continue corrected bounded delivery"]
```

**Bad smell**

The user says "the three benchmarks should run on the remote development
machine, but Codex stays local and the remote host is only the execution
environment"; a later agent turn treats missing remote Codex/Codex-ACP as the
main blocker or keeps following a stale local-only benchmark staging todo.

**Validation**

- `skills/loopx-self-repair/references/repair-patterns.md`
- `docs/state-interaction-model.md`
- future `user_reward_lesson_projection_gap` status/quota smoke that checks
  explicit operating lessons are projected into `recommended_action`,
  active `Agent Todo`, or a state-projection repair warning.

#### IP-009 Active User Assistance

**Trigger**

- the experiment or product lane explicitly enables active user assistance;
- an intervention budget/frequency policy exists;
- hidden tests, reward/pass/fail, expected solutions, and credentials remain
  hidden from the worker.

**Expected behavior**

The assistant or user simulator may provide bounded help through an audited
channel. Results must be labeled as assisted and must not be merged into
official autonomous score claims.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Sim as User simulator
  participant GH as LoopX
  participant Agent as Agent
  Sim->>GH: Public-safe intervention within budget
  GH->>Agent: Audited assistance channel
  Agent->>GH: Assisted result evidence

### State And Boundary

#### IP-005 State Projection Gap

**Trigger**

- quota says work is eligible or `must_attempt=true`;
- `agent_todo_summary.open_count=0` and `user_todo_summary.open_count=0`;
- `Next Action`, handoff prose, or recent run history still contains
  actionable work.
- compatibility lint sees explicit user-wait prose in `Next Action`, but no
  structured `User Todo` or `interaction_contract.user_channel` gate exists.

**Expected behavior**

The next step should become replan / todo expansion / blocker writeback rather
than normal delivery. Machine projection must be repaired before the controller
pretends there is no work.

When structured fields are present, they are authoritative over Markdown lint.
If `interaction_contract.user_channel.action_required=false`,
`user_todo_summary.open_count=0`, and an executable agent todo exists, the
controller should continue bounded agent work instead of asking the agent to
report "具体 user todo 未投影". Conversely, if a real owner/user gate exists, it
must be represented as a concrete user todo or scoped decision rather than only
as prose in `Next Action`.

**Visual Model**

  O -->|"no"| P{"actionable Next Action or handoff prose?"}
  P -->|"yes"| R["replan / todo expansion / blocker writeback"]
  P -->|"no"| M["monitor or quiet no-op"]
```

**Bad smell**

Humans can see a next action in prose, but the machine projection sees no open
todo and the automation drifts into monitor-only no-ops.

**Validation**

- `examples/state-projection-gap-smoke.py`
- `docs/project-agent-todo-contract.md`

#### IP-006 Checkpointed Scope Mismatch

**Trigger**

- the selected todo or `recommended_action` requires writing a scope;
- `goal_boundary.write_scope` does not include that scope;
- a historical owner decision may exist, but it is not projected into the
  current boundary contract.

**Expected behavior**

LoopX should return boundary projection repair or a concrete
user/controller gate. The agent should not execute the write, and should not
spend turns on repo-only handoff if the real blocker is missing scope
projection.

Only structured checkpointed authority can extend the runtime boundary. A
historical approval written in prose is not enough. The registry may carry
`coordination.checkpointed_boundary_authority[]` entries with:

- `schema_version=checkpointed_boundary_authority_v0`;
- `write_scope`;
- `source` or equivalent public-safe provenance;
- `recorded_at`;
- optional `expires_at`;
- `decision=approve` and active status.

Fresh approved entries are compiled into `goal_boundary.write_scope` and
exposed under `goal_boundary.checkpointed_boundary_authority`. Expired,
rejected, missing-provenance, or missing-timestamp entries remain visible only
as diagnostics; they do not authorize writes.

  A["selected action"] --> S{"requires write scope?"}

  C -->|"no"| B{"scope already in explicit write_scope?"}
  P --> B
  B -->|"yes"| E
  B -->|"no"| R["boundary projection repair or user/controller gate"]
```

**Bad smell**

The control plane remembers that a user once approved a path, but the current
quota boundary blocks it, so agents loop on small handoffs instead of repairing
the checkpointed decision.

#### IP-011 Authority Material Intake

**Trigger**

- a worker discovers or receives a durable design doc, research memo, owner
  packet, migration report, benchmark paper, external registry, or other source
  that future agents may need;
- the target project and `goal_id` are known;
- the material can be represented as public-safe metadata without storing raw
  URLs, document ids, local paths, source bodies, comments, credentials, or
  private logs.

**Expected behavior**

The agent should first identify the owning project, then register a compact
source contract in that project's authority surface. If the project has a
tracked `docs/meta/DOC_REGISTRY.yaml`, update that authority map first. If it
does not, use the project-local `.loopx/registry.json` through
`authority_registry.topic_authority` and `authority_registry.project_materials`.
This distinction is a storage/publication boundary, not two competing authority
systems: tracked `DOC_REGISTRY` files are project assets for review, while the
ignored `authority_registry` fallback is LoopX control-plane state.

The stored material should answer what it is, how fresh it is, which topic it
governs, whether owner review or read access is needed, and how conflicts are
resolved. It should not read or summarize the material body as part of the
registration step.

**Bad smell**

An agent remembers an important article or design only in chat, or registers it
into the meta controller because that is the current repo, even though the
material belongs to another connected project.

#### IP-016 Task Lease Claim

**Trigger**

- multiple agents, heartbeats, child workers, or frontstage channel views may
  act on the same todo;
- the selected work has a bounded `todo_id`, owner, TTL, write scope, and
  idempotency key;
- the system needs to prevent duplicate work, duplicate spend, or overlapping
  writes without moving truth into chat.

**Expected behavior**

A task claim should become `task_lease_v0`: an explicit, expiring claim over
one bounded todo. The pending key is `(goal_id, todo_id)`: `goal_id` names the
control-plane lane, while `todo_id` names the work item inside it. Different
todos inside the same goal do not conflict merely because they share a goal;
only competing pending leases for the same `todo_id` or overlapping write
scopes should conflict. Status and future channel projections may render the
claim, but the lease remains a projection over the LoopX ledger and does
not override `goal_boundary`, user gates, quota, or write-scope checks.

When a lease is active and the selected action is inside its scope, the owner
may proceed. When a competing worker sees an active overlapping lease, it must
choose a non-overlapping fallback, wait, or surface a conflict. Expired leases
need cleanup or renewal before they authorize continued work.

#### IP-019 Side-Agent Scoped Continuation

**Trigger**

- a shared-control-plane goal declares `coordination.registered_agents` and one
  `coordination.primary_agent`;
- a side agent has an automation prompt or handoff scope, such as product docs,
  showcase work, validation, or another low-conflict side lane;
- an in-scope agent todo can be claimed with `claimed_by`, while the primary
  agent remains responsible for high-risk review, publication, reassignment,
  and merge decisions outside self-merge policy.

**Expected behavior**

The control plane should keep identity and ownership visible without turning
scope into todo metadata. The side agent learns its scope from the automation
prompt or handoff, then claims only a concrete in-scope todo:

```bash
loopx todo claim \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by <side-agent-id>
```

Repository edits happen in an independent worktree/branch. When the slice is
small, validated, public-safe, and allowed by repository policy, the side agent
may self-merge and complete the todo with evidence:

```bash
loopx todo complete \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by <side-agent-id> \
  --side-agent-self-merged \
  --evidence "<commit, validation, and self-merge summary>"
```

If the self-merged lane has an obvious same-scope continuation, the completion
may atomically add a successor and claim it back to the same side agent. If the
work is broad, risky, unclear, or outside the side scope, completion must create
a primary review todo claimed by the primary agent instead. `claimed_by` remains
a soft owner and not a permission grant: quota, user gates, public/private
boundary checks, write scopes, and repository rules still apply.

Because prompt text alone is not a reliable guard, `quota should-run --agent-id
<side-agent-id>` should also project `workspace_guard` when the side agent is
running from the registered primary checkout, a non-git directory, or an
unrelated git worktree. In that state `normal_delivery_allowed=false` and
`interaction_contract.mode=side_agent_workspace_repair`: the only allowed action
is to create or switch to an independent worktree/branch and rerun the guard
before editing repository files. Moving workspaces is a preflight repair and
does not get quota spend.

The same scoped identity must be carried through the whole successful turn.
If `quota should-run` was evaluated with `--agent-id <side-agent-id>`, follow-up
commands that interpret the same turn's control-plane state, especially
`refresh-state` and `quota spend-slot`, should use that same registered
`--agent-id` when the subcommand supports it. Otherwise the spend/accounting
preview can be evaluated as an unscoped automation and report
`automation_prompt_upgrade_required` even though the delivery decision was
made under a valid side-agent scope. The fix is not to ignore that warning; the
fix is to preserve the identity envelope across guard, writeback, accounting,
and rollout evidence.

```

**Bad smell**

A side agent edits the primary checkout, chooses work from chat memory instead
of the shared todo list, encodes scope into todo metadata, self-merges broad or
runtime-sensitive work, or creates a review successor and claims it back to
itself without the explicit self-merge path. A related bad smell is treating
"the prompt said use a worktree" as sufficient product protection; the guard
must be machine-visible before the first file edit. Another bad smell is a
scoped side-agent run that passes `quota should-run --agent-id ...` but later
spends without `--agent-id`, producing an unscoped accounting snapshot that
looks like a stale automation prompt instead of the completed scoped turn.

#### IP-020 Todo Claim / Supersede / Successor Lifecycle

**Trigger**

- a selected agent todo has a stable `todo_id` and the current agent is about
  to spend a delivery turn on it;
- a todo has become stale because the user changed the route, new evidence made
  the old wording wrong, or a narrower replacement should become the first
  executable item;
- a non-trivial slice is complete but the feature still needs rollout,
  product-path proof, docs, benchmark evidence, telemetry, or review;
- multiple registered agents can see the same checklist and need ownership to
  be visible without moving scope into todo metadata.

**Expected behavior**

The agent claims concrete work before delivery:

```bash
loopx todo claim \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by <agent-id>
```

`claimed_by` is a soft owner, not permission. It must be checked against
registered agent ids and must not bypass quota, user gates, write boundaries,
repository policy, validation, or public/private scans.

When an open todo is wrong rather than merely incomplete, the agent should
supersede it instead of editing its text in place or marking it done:

```bash
loopx todo supersede \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --reason "<public-safe reason>" \
  --next-agent-todo "<replacement executable action>"
```

Supersede preserves the old work item as history, records `superseded_by`, and
makes the replacement the durable current route. Use it for route changes,
stale benchmark lanes, narrowed blockers, or user-corrected priorities.

When a non-trivial slice is completed, the completion must either create a
successor todo or record why no successor is needed:

```bash
loopx todo complete \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --evidence "<public-safe validation or artifact>" \
  --next-agent-todo "<next rollout/proof/docs/review step>"
```

Successor todos are the lightweight lifecycle model. LoopX should not
grow many feature states such as slice_done, rolled_out, or proven_in_product
unless a UI/runtime need appears. A done todo means the current slice is done;
the successor expresses the next slice. If there is truly no follow-up, the
completion note must include a compact no-follow-up rationale.

  F -->|"no"| X["complete with no-follow-up rationale"]
  U --> Q["refresh-state / quota projects successor"]
  N --> Q
  X --> Q
```

**Bad smell**

The agent starts work without claiming the todo, rewrites an open todo after a
route correction so history is lost, marks a broad feature done after one PR
without a successor, creates a successor only in chat, or treats `claimed_by` as
permission to ignore gates and boundaries.

#### IP-022 Claimed Todo Visibility And Agent-Lane Next Action

**Trigger**

- status or quota summarizes a todo set with more open work than the small
  scheduler top-N can show;
- registered agents use `claimed_by`, especially side agents whose scoped work
  may sit behind higher-priority primary or benchmark todos;
- a dashboard, review packet, or heartbeat prompt needs to show ownership,
  current-agent work, and monitor responsibilities without changing which
  executable todo the scheduler selects.

**Expected behavior**

Todo projection has two jobs that should not collapse into one list:

1. **Scheduling**: choose a narrow set of runnable candidates for the current
   guard, capability check, and steering audit.
2. **Visibility**: keep ownership, claimed work, and monitor lanes observable
   for humans, dashboards, and scoped agents.

Status and quota may still expose `first_open_items`,
`first_executable_items`, and `executable_backlog_items` as compact scheduler
surfaces. They should also project bounded visibility lanes:

- `unclaimed_priority_open_items`: priority-ranked unclaimed work that an agent
  may consider claiming;
- `claimed_open_items`: claimed work that may be outside the scheduler top-N;
- `claimed_advancement_open_items`: claimed executable delivery work;
- `claimed_monitor_open_items`: claimed continuous-monitor work;
- for agent-scoped quota payloads,
  `current_agent_claimed_open_items`,
  `current_agent_claimed_advancement_items`,
  `current_agent_claimed_monitor_items`, and `claimed_by_others_items`.

The default agent-facing lane cap should remain modest, currently 16 items per
lane, with count fields showing when more work exists. Rich frontstage views
that need more than this should use a paged or filtered projection rather than
inflating every heartbeat/quota payload. Monitor lanes remain visibility
context unless they record a material transition or blocker; they should not
steal the advancement slot simply because they are claimed.

When a claimed visibility lane has more items than the lane cap, truncation
should be claimant-balanced rather than raw top-N. First sort claimed items by
priority and source position, then group them by `claimed_by`, take a fair
per-claimant slice within the cap, and fill any remaining slots from the
priority-ordered remainder. The goal is not strict round-robin display order;
it is to keep one agent's long queue from hiding another agent's claimed work.

Agent-scoped quota then applies focus ordering after visibility balancing:
current-agent claimed items first, unclaimed items second, and other-agent
claimed items last with lower weight. Other-agent claims remain visible and may
be inspected when nothing better is available, but they should not crowd out
the current agent's own claimed advancement or genuinely unclaimed work.
`claimed_by` remains a soft ownership signal, not a lock, lease, capability
grant, or gate bypass.

For agent-scoped execution payloads, quota may also expose a narrow
`agent_lane_next_action` object with
`schema_version=agent_lane_next_action_v0`. It is derived from the same scoped
runnable queue: prefer `capability_gate.runnable_candidates`, then
`agent_todo_summary.first_executable_items`, then
`agent_todo_summary.executable_backlog_items`; filter out other-agent claimed
todos; select current-agent claimed todos before unclaimed fallback, and within
that claim bucket prefer `capability_repair_mode=true` before ordinary runnable
work of the same priority. This object is an agent-lane pointer, not a goal-level route rewrite,
so it must include `preserves_goal_next_action=true`. Status may attach the same
object for `--agent-id` observation, but it must not replace the item
`recommended_action`, `project_asset.next_action`, owner, or waiting lane.

```

**Bad smell**

A side agent claims a productization todo, but status/quota only expose the
first few priority-ranked benchmark todos. The agent then appears idle or
unowned work appears available even though the control plane already knows its
owner. The opposite bad smell is also harmful: a large claimed-work list is fed
directly into the scheduler or heartbeat prompt, causing noisy routing and
monitor work to crowd out the selected advancement lane.

#### IP-026 Agent-Scoped No-Candidate Gap

**Trigger**

- `quota should-run --agent-id <agent>` returns `should_run=true` or
  `interaction_contract.agent_channel.must_attempt=true`;
- the same payload has no `agent_lane_next_action`;
- `current_agent_claimed_advancement_items` is empty;
- no runnable candidate is projected for that agent; and
- the recommended action points at another agent's lane, an out-of-scope lane,
  or a goal-level route the current agent cannot safely advance.

**Expected behavior**

Agent-scoped quota must distinguish "the goal has runnable work" from "this
agent has runnable work." When the current agent has no in-scope candidate,
quota should not force a delivery turn. It first checks whether the scoped
frontier is truly empty or whether a deferred successor has become ready.

Deferred work should stay machine-readable without becoming executable backlog
too early. A deferred todo may carry `resume_when=<token>`, initially
`resume_when=todo_done:<todo_id>`. Status evaluates the condition, adds
`resume_condition`, and marks `resume_ready=true` only after the target todo is
done. Status and quota expose deferred work after sorted open lanes through
bounded visibility fields:

- `deferred_items`: sorted visibility for deferred todos;
- `deferred_resume_candidates`: sorted visibility for ready deferred todos;
- default cap: 8 deferred items per lane.

These fields are visibility and replan input, not normal delivery permission.
Consumers must not merge them into `first_open_items` or executable backlog
until a lifecycle command reopens or supersedes the todo.

For agent-scoped quota, ready deferred candidates are split by claim:

- `current_agent_deferred_resume_candidates`;
- `unclaimed_deferred_resume_candidates`;
- `other_agent_deferred_resume_candidates`.

Only current-agent and unclaimed ready deferred candidates can wake that side
agent. Other-agent deferred candidates remain diagnostic visibility. If the
side agent has no open current-agent or unclaimed advancement todo but does
have a ready current-agent/unclaimed deferred candidate, quota should return:

```text
effective_action=successor_replan_required
should_run=true
normal_delivery_allowed=false
execution_obligation.contract=deferred_resume_projection
interaction_contract.agent_channel.must_attempt=true
interaction_contract.agent_channel.quiet_noop_allowed=false
```

The bounded action is to reopen the deferred todo, supersede it with a current
successor, or record a public-safe no-follow-up rationale. Only after that
writeback may normal delivery resume.

If no ready current-agent or unclaimed deferred successor exists, quota should
project one of these machine states instead:

- `scope_exhausted`: no current-agent or unclaimed candidate matches the
  registered agent profile and boundary;
- `primary_review_wait`: the remaining useful step is review, merge,
  reassignment, or decision by the primary agent/controller;
- `reassignment_required`: useful work exists, but ownership must be changed
  before this agent may treat it as its lane.

The interaction contract should then set:

```text
agent_channel.must_attempt=false
agent_channel.delivery_allowed=false
agent_channel.quiet_noop_allowed=true
```

The user channel remains quiet unless a concrete user todo exists. The
recommended action should name the scoped condition, not borrow the global
goal-level route. A side agent should be allowed to no-op without spend, or
claim a newly exposed in-scope todo before delivery becomes allowed again.

This pattern is the runtime counterpart of IP-022. IP-022 makes claimed,
deferred, and agent-lane work visible; IP-026 says what to do when that scoped
frontier is empty or when a deferred successor makes it non-empty again.

```

**Bad smell**

A side-agent heartbeat receives `should_run=true`,
`delivery_allowed=true`, and `quiet_noop_allowed=false` even though
`agent_lane_next_action=None`, `current_agent_claimed_advancement_items=[]`,
and the only recommendation is a primary-owned benchmark or runtime lane. The
agent either churns through repeated empty heartbeats or risks working outside
its registered scope. A related failure is a ready deferred successor that
remains visible only in a quiet no-candidate payload; the side agent reports
"nothing runnable" until a human notices and asks for the next productization
layer. The opposite bad smell is also harmful: deferred items are mixed into
the open todo list, so stale or future work outranks live open tasks.

**Validation**

- future quota/status regression with two registered agents where all runnable
  work is claimed by the primary and the side-agent `--agent-id` call returns
  `scope_exhausted` or `primary_review_wait`;
- `examples/work-lane-contract-smoke.py` should cover that an empty
  current-agent frontier cannot produce `delivery_allowed=true`, and that a
  ready deferred successor returns `successor_replan_required` instead of a
  quiet no-op;

#### IP-023 Status Neutral Run Window

**Trigger**

- `quota should-run` reports no user action or quiet monitor behavior, but
  `status` / `diagnose --limit N` falls back to a stale registry state,
  controller gate, or older connected-without-run state;
- recent history is dominated by status-neutral entries such as quota monitor
  polls, slot-spend records, readiness pings, or display-only refreshes;
- a short UI/history limit hides the latest meaningful state transition just
  behind the visible window.

**Expected behavior**

Status, diagnose, quota, and history should share the same neutral-run
classification contract. Neutral runs are real evidence for cadence and stall
analysis, but they are not authoritative state transitions by themselves. When
computing the current control-plane state, the implementation should reason
over an internal window wide enough to skip neutral noise and find the latest
meaningful state run before trimming the run list for UI display.

UI display limit must not become the control-plane reasoning window. A user can
ask for `--limit 5` to keep output compact, but state selection should still
look far enough back to avoid projecting a fake controller/user gate. If no
meaningful state run exists inside the internal reasoning window, status should
say that explicitly instead of inventing a gate.

A monitor-only loop fills the most recent five history rows, so `status --limit
5` claims the agent needs a controller connection or user decision even though
quota says `monitor_quiet_skip` and no user todo is open. The bad state is not
that monitor rows exist; it is that a presentation limit changed the meaning of
the control plane.

**Validation**

- `skills/loopx-self-repair/references/repair-patterns.md`
- future regression where the latest N runs are neutral and the N+1 run is the
  authoritative state transition.

#### IP-025 Experimental Diagnostic Sidecar Boundary

**Trigger**

- a route-specific proof or debug tool emits verdict fields, such as Codex CLI
  visible attach decisions, runtime-idle blockers, continuation outcomes, or
  fallback contracts;
- an implementation proposes copying those verdicts into a stable hot-path
  agent packet, status schema, dashboard contract, or `protocol_action_packet_v0`;
- the verdict semantics still depend on one experimental surface, a human
  observation, a fixture-only proof, or a temporary product question.

**Expected behavior**

Experimental proof/debug verdicts are sidecar diagnostics first. They may be
public-safe, structured, versioned, and useful, but they do not become stable
agent-facing packet fields until the abstraction is product-general and
validated across the surfaces that will consume it.

The stable hot path should keep expressing generic control-plane obligations:
user action, agent action, work lane, gate state, quiet-noop allowance, spend
policy, and compact action label. Route-specific proof fields stay in the
sidecar that owns their evidence. For the current Codex CLI/TUI path, verdicts
such as `visible_session_proof_required`,
`runtime_idle_evidence_required`, `same_tui_visible_attach_accepted`,
`accepted_for_same_tui_automation`, `continuation_outcome`, and
`fallback_contract` belong in the visible attach/proof or observation packet,
not in `protocol_action_packet_v0` or the routine quota/status packet shape.

Promotion from sidecar to stable schema needs an explicit schema decision:

- the field name is not tied to one route's debug wording;
- at least one non-Codex-CLI or future-runtime consumer can use the same
  abstraction without reinterpretation;
- public/private boundaries and no-transcript/no-session-file constraints are
  documented;
- failure modes are represented as generic obligations or blockers, not as
  product-spike labels;
- smoke tests prove both the sidecar verdict and the stable packet remain
  compatible.

The Codex CLI/TUI consequence is narrow but important: a manual
same-open-TUI observation can prove that the first bootstrap continuation stayed
visible, while scheduled same-TUI attach remains blocked by proof/idle
requirements. That distinction is valid evidence, but it should not force every
agent heartbeat or dashboard row to learn Codex-specific verdict fields.

  H --> C
```

**Bad smell**

A proof spike adds `same_tui_visible_attach_accepted` or
`visible_session_proof_required` directly to a generic runtime packet, and
future agents start treating a Codex CLI debug verdict as a universal routing
field. The opposite bad smell is losing the proof entirely: the diagnostic
sidecar is public-safe and useful, but no doc or smoke says why it stayed out of
the stable schema.

### Evidence Lifecycle

#### IP-012 External Evidence Observation

**Trigger**

- `waiting_on=external_evidence`, a launched external worker is being polled, or
  `interaction_contract.mode=external_evidence_observation`;
- the selected action is evidence observation, compact result ingest, or compact
  blocker writeback;
- benchmark/model/Docker/cloud execution is not explicitly authorized by the
  current guard.

**Expected behavior**

The agent must distinguish observing an external handle from launching new
external work. If a compact handle exists, it may poll or ingest compact
public-safe result files. If the required handle is missing, the correct action
is a compact blocker or projection repair, not a quiet no-op. Benchmark
execution, model calls, Docker, cloud jobs, uploads, and leaderboard paths stay
blocked unless the guard explicitly selects that work.

**Visual Model**

  P -->|"no"| O["bounded poll; no spend if unchanged"]
  P -->|"yes"| I["ingest compact result or blocker"]
  I --> V["validate boundary and write event"]
  V --> N["next guard decision"]
```

**Bad smell**

The heartbeat treats external-evidence waiting as a harmless quiet skip even
though the guard requires an observable handle, or it launches a benchmark run
from a meta/controller poll that was only authorized to observe.

- `examples/benchmark-lifecycle-state-smoke.py`
- `docs/state-interaction-model.md`

#### IP-015 Benchmark Lifecycle Countability

**Trigger**

- a benchmark adapter, runner wrapper, or reducer observes preflight, launch,
  materialization, compact result, comparison, claim review, or learning-ledger
  evidence;
- a controller is deciding whether a process launch, case attempt, score,
  budget spend, rerun, or public claim is countable.

**Expected behavior**

Benchmark work should advance through compact lifecycle gates instead of raw
runner narratives. `process_started` alone is not case entry. Case entry starts
at `job_root_materialized` or later. Budget/counting and candidate selection
require compact result ingestion, claim boundary review, and learning-ledger
state where applicable. Terminal failure markers can close out a launched
attempt without making it a case attempt or benchmark-budget event.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid

  R --> C["claim / attribution review"]
  C --> G{"learning ledger ready?"}
  G -->|"no"| W["block budget count / candidate switch"]
  G -->|"yes"| K["budget count allowed"]
```

**Bad smell**

A runner PID, detached process, stale active job, or raw log tail is treated as
evidence of a benchmark case attempt or score claim before the compact lifecycle
state says it is countable.

### Planning Governance

#### IP-013 Autonomous Replan Vs Advisory Dreaming

**Trigger**

- no-progress streaks, repeated action loops, phase transitions, or periodic
  review thresholds make a blocking `autonomous_replan_obligation_v0` visible
  in active state, status, quota, or run history; or
- a background planning lane surfaces `dreaming_proposal_v0` /
  `server_managed_planning_contract_v0` as advisory context.

**Expected behavior**

An autonomous replan obligation is executable repair work: split, add, retire,
or re-rank todos so the next delivery segment can advance. A dreaming proposal
is advisory until promoted by an operator/controller decision and a normal
quota/boundary check. Dreaming proposals may be displayed alongside a blocking
replan obligation, but they stay a side lane: they can inform review or repair,
not enter promotion/execution until the blocking replan obligation is absent or
resolved. The two lanes must not collapse into each other.

Replan closeout is explicit. A normal validated progress refresh may record
useful work, but it must not silently close the
`autonomous_replan_obligation_v0`. After the agent performs the bounded replan
slice and writes back the selected todo/guidance changes, it must append a
structured ACK:

```bash
loopx refresh-state \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --classification autonomous_replan_recorded \
  --autonomous-replan-recorded \
  --delivery-batch-scale <scale> \
  --delivery-outcome <outcome>
```

The resulting run carries `autonomous_replan_ack_v0`. Classification remains a
human-readable history label; the structured ACK is the control-plane signal
that lets status/quota stop projecting the replan obligation. This keeps agents
responsible for actively closing the loop instead of relying on loose
classification wording such as `autonomous_replan_validated_*`.

A replan ACK should also change the work frontier. It should add, split,
supersede, complete-with-successor, or block a todo, or else record an explicit
watch-lane continuation. If the runnable todo set, user gate, blocker state,
monitor target, or `effective_action` does not change, the replan is likely a
no-op and should not hide the stall.

**Visual Model**

  S["status / run history"] --> R{"blocking replan obligation visible?"}
  S --> D{"dreaming proposal present?"}
  D -->|"yes"| V["display advisory dreaming side lane"]
  D -->|"no"| Z["no dreaming side lane"]
  R -->|"yes"| A["execute bounded replan repair"]
  A --> T["update todos / guidance"]
  T --> C["append structured replan ACK"]

  U --> P{"promoted and boundary approved?"}
  P -->|"yes"| Q
  P -->|"no"| X["proposal remains non-executable"]
  G -->|"no"| N["normal selected interaction mode"]
```

**Bad smell**

A proposal from the dreaming/planning lane carries an `agent_command` or spends
delivery quota before promotion. The opposite failure is also costly: repeated
no-progress evidence is treated as optional brainstorming instead of a required
state repair. A subtler failure is treating
`autonomous_replan_validated_*` or another progress classification as equivalent
to a replan ACK; that hides whether the agent actually split/retired/added the
needed control-plane work and closed the obligation. A related bad case is a
replan ACK that records effort but leaves the exact same monitor/action
recommendation as the next machine-visible route.

- `regression/autonomous-replan-vs-dreaming-contract.py`
- `docs/archive/incidents/monitor-only-replan-stall-incident-20260621.md`

#### IP-024 Repair Delta Contract

**Trigger**

- self-repair, replan, or no-progress handling records activity, but the next
  quota/status packet returns the same monitor/action recommendation;
- repeated monitor-only, replan, or repair-adjacent runs do not create a new
  runnable todo, blocker, successor, supersede record, user gate, capability
  change, workspace guard change, or monitor-target change;
- an agent says it repaired the state, but the machine-visible work frontier is
  identical before and after the repair.

**Expected behavior**

A successful repair/replan must change the machine-visible frontier. At least
one of these surfaces should change:

- selected `effective_action` or interaction contract;
- runnable todo set, claimed work lane, successor, or supersede relationship;
- concrete user question/todo or blocker;
- capability/workspace guard outcome;
- monitor target, expiry, watch-lane rationale, or evidence handle;
- active-state Next Action or goal-boundary projection.

If none of those change, the repair should be recorded as a no-op or unresolved
blocker, not as progress. The next safe action should then be to create the
missing successor/blocker/supersede/watch-lane record, or to stop with a clear
reason that the current monitor is intentionally quiet. This is separate from
IP-013's replan ACK: the ACK closes the obligation, while the delta contract
proves that closing it did not hide the same stuck route.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  R["self-repair or replan run"] --> B["snapshot before/after frontier"]
  B --> C{"any machine-visible delta?"}
  C -->|"yes"| P["record progress and rerun quota"]
  C -->|"no"| N["classify repair_noop / replan_noop"]
  N --> D{"why no delta?"}
  D -->|"stale route"| S["supersede or create successor todo"]
  D -->|"real blocker"| K["record blocker or user todo"]
  D -->|"intentional watch"| W["record monitor target + expiry"]
```

**Bad smell**

The agent performs a replan, appends a history row, and reports that the loop
was handled. The next heartbeat still receives the same recommended action,
same monitor target, same todo set, and same lack of blocker. That is not a
resolved repair; it is an unclosed control-plane loop with better narration.

**Validation**

- `docs/archive/incidents/monitor-only-replan-stall-incident-20260621.md`
- `skills/loopx-self-repair/references/repair-patterns.md`
- future regression that compares before/after frontier fields for repair and
  replan closeout runs.

#### IP-010 Cadence Widening

**Trigger**

- recent eligible turns have a small-step streak;
- delivery repeatedly lands as `single_surface`, status-only, or shallow docs
  without a coherent artifact;
- no safety boundary prevents a larger segment.

**Expected behavior**

The controller widens the next eligible turn according to the configured
cadence preset. For the default `long` preset, a turn should usually include an
artifact, focused validation, and state writeback.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  R["recent turns"] --> S{"small-step streak >= threshold?"}
  S -->|"no"| C["keep current cadence"]
  S -->|"yes"| B{"safe to widen?"}
  B -->|"no"| G["ask gate or write blocker"]
  B -->|"yes"| W["widen next segment by preset"]
  W --> D["artifact + validation + writeback"]
```

**Bad smell**

The agent's native long-task ability is degraded because the control plane keeps
asking it to do tiny heartbeat-shaped steps.

**Validation**

- `docs/long-task-cadence-policy.md`
- future status/quota preset projection smoke.

#### IP-018 Plan To Todo Writeback

**Trigger**

- the agent tells the user a connected LoopX plan, top-todo list,
  route change, benchmark branch policy, deprecation policy, or priority stack;
- the plan contains concrete future P0/P1/P2 work, user actions, route
  decisions, or cleanup/deprecation commitments;
- future agents would need that plan to choose the next bounded segment.

**Expected behavior**

User-facing plans are not durable control-plane state by themselves. Before the
final response, the agent must do one of:

- add or update concrete `Agent Todo` / `User Todo` items;
- refresh `Next Action` or the latest run's `recommended_action`;
- write a public-safe doc/catalog entry and add the corresponding todo;
- explicitly say the plan is speculative and no writeback was performed.

This keeps the model's understanding, the user's mental plan, and LoopX
state from diverging. It also prevents a later heartbeat from following a stale
`recommended_action` even though the previous turn already explained a better
route.

**Visual Model**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  P["agent explains plan / top todos / route change"] --> C{"concrete future work?"}
  C -->|"no"| A["answer normally"]
  C -->|"yes"| W{"writeback target"}
  W --> T["todo add/update"]
  W --> N["Next Action / refresh-state"]
  W --> D["doc/catalog plus todo"]
  W --> R["no-writeback rationale"]
  T --> Q["quota/status can project it"]
  N --> Q
  D --> Q
  R --> F["final says speculative/no durable change"]
```

**Bad smell**

The agent says "current Top Todo: P0 cloud Codex login, P0 pull clean benchmark
workspaces, P1 split-control retrospective, P1 branch hygiene runbook", but the
active LoopX state contains only one broad P0 and none of the P1
successor work. The next automation then behaves as if the plan never existed.

**Validation**

- `skills/loopx-project/SKILL.md`
- `skills/loopx-self-repair/references/repair-patterns.md`
- `examples/heartbeat-prompt-smoke.py`
- future status/quota smoke that flags user-facing plans without todo or
  refresh-state writeback.

## Maintenance Rules

Add or update a pattern when any of these happens:

1. a good case demonstrates a reusable product behavior;
2. a bad case or incident reveals a missing state projection;
3. a smoke encodes a behavior that is not yet explained to humans;
4. a dashboard/status field changes who owns the next action.

Every new pattern should link to at least one validation path. If validation
does not exist yet, mark it as a future smoke rather than hiding the gap.

When a pattern is useful for partner/user explanation, add a visual artifact or
explicitly mark the visual as future work. Good visuals should show ownership
and the allowed next action, not just boxes for implementation modules.

Do not let this catalog become a second source of truth. The source of truth is
still the runtime state, quota/status payloads, and event ledger. This catalog
is the human-maintained map of the situations those payloads must express.
