# Public / Private Boundary

LoopX is designed to be public, but most useful goal evidence is not.

## Public

These are safe to keep in the public repository:

- schemas,
- runtime directory conventions,
- generic CLI code,
- adapter lifecycle rules,
- controller/sub-agent lifecycle states,
- generic coordination rules,
- validation commands,
- sanitized examples,
- high-level design notes.

## Private

These should stay in project-local ignored files:

- local absolute paths,
- internal repository names,
- raw logs and metrics,
- task ids,
- document links,
- credentials and tokens,
- person or team names from private work,
- active goal state that reveals current user context,
- raw sub-agent prompts and traces,
- child run evidence that contains local paths or private artifacts.

## Sub-Agent Data

Sub-agent orchestration increases leakage risk because child prompts often
contain more context than the final report needs. Public artifacts should keep:

- schema names,
- role names,
- sanitized work-scope examples,
- lifecycle states,
- generic merge rules.

Private project state should keep:

- raw child prompts,
- raw trajectories,
- local task evidence,
- non-public repo names,
- exact command output when it contains project-specific context.

Run summaries are publishable only after sanitization.

## Practical Rule

The public repo should answer: "How does a loopx work?"

The project repo should answer: "What is this specific goal currently doing?"

The runtime root should answer: "What happened in recent goal ticks?"

Real controller state belongs in ignored local files such as
`.codex/goals/<goal-id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`,
`.local/goals/<goal-id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`, or the shared runtime root. A
public repository may track sanitized templates, fixtures, and compact
projections, but not the live file that a controller updates on every turn.

`loopx check` treats that as a file-state boundary, not just a path-name
boundary. Local private state that is not tracked by git may contain private
document links because it is not a publishable artifact. If that same file is
tracked by git, it enters the public boundary and is scanned like any other
publishable file.

Projects that intentionally publish tracked files with private document links
can opt in through the project registry:

```json
{
  "public_boundary": {
    "tracked_private_doc_urls": "allow"
  }
}
```

This policy only allows `private_doc_url` findings in tracked files. It does
not allow credentials, tokens, passwords, private IPs, internal task ids, or
local private paths.

If a runtime-only goal is obsolete, archive its directory rather than copying
private run payloads into public notes:

```bash
loopx archive-runtime --goal-id old-experiment-goal
loopx archive-runtime --goal-id old-experiment-goal --execute
```

The first command is a dry-run. The second moves the local runtime directory
under `<runtime-root>/archived-goals/`; it does not sanitize or publish the
payload.

## Private-Safe Pilot Checklist

Before a private project becomes a LoopX pilot, define this boundary in
the project-local active state or registry. Do this before reading private
evidence, launching adapters, or publishing a public fixture.

- Goal identity: stable `goal_id`, public-safe objective, owner mode, and the
  exact question the pilot should answer.
- Evidence classes: list source roles such as design authority, owner review,
  source repository, target repository, validation dashboard, and historical
  notes without naming private URLs, repos, people, teams, or product configs.
- Public projection: decide which fields may leave the project, such as role,
  freshness, missing gate, next action, validation surface, quota state, and
  stop condition.
- Private retention: keep raw links, paths, metrics, logs, task ids, review
  text, generated config, and implementation diffs in project-local ignored
  state or the runtime root.
- Write scope: state whether the first pilot pass is read-only, local-state
  only, public fixture only, or allowed to edit project files.
- Gate order: require health and boundary scan, then owner or controller gate,
  then evidence readiness, then compute quota, then Codex execution.
- Validation surface: name the smallest public-safe check that proves the
  pilot's projection is useful, such as `read-only-map`, `status`, review
  packet, dashboard render, or a fixture smoke.
- Handoff rule: if a missing owner action appears, write it as a user todo; if
  a safe project-agent follow-up appears, write it as an agent todo. Do not
  hide either in `Next Action`.
- Publication stop: do not commit or push a pilot artifact unless the artifact
  itself passes the public/private scan and the private evidence remains in
  project-local state.

The first public artifact from a private pilot should usually be a sanitized
fixture or status schema. The first private artifact should be a compact
project-local state update that says which private sources were considered and
why they were or were not safe to project.
