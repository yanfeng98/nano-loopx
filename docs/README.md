# Goal Harness Documentation

This directory is intentionally split by audience. New contributors should be
able to find the stable product contracts without reading every research note,
incident report, or launch draft.

## Start Here

- [Project README](../README.md): product positioning, showcases, and the
  shortest quick start.
- [Getting started](guides/getting-started.md): agent-first start, manual
  installation, project connection, diagnosis, daily workflow, heartbeats,
  dashboard, development, and command reference.
- [Product vision](product/vision.md): long-term product direction and the
  creator-operator medium-term case.
- [Codex CLI TUI-first loop](product/codex-cli-tui-loop.md): first-class
  Codex CLI onboarding target where one visible TUI message starts Goal
  Harness, with session-attached automation as the preferred follow-up.
- [Codex CLI first-run rehearsal](product/codex-cli-first-run-rehearsal.md):
  shortest public route from no-clone install to one-message TUI bootstrap and
  proof-capture fixtures.
- [Architecture](architecture.md): core concepts and control-plane shape.
- [Integration guide](integration.md): how to connect a project to Goal
  Harness.
- [Showcases](showcases/README.md): public-safe cases, reproducible demos, and
  frontend-ready case metadata.
- [Benchmark developer workflow](benchmark-developer-workflow.md): how to run,
  observe, and ingest benchmark slices as a developer-facing product workflow.
- [State interaction model](state-interaction-model.md): user, agent, and state
  channel flow.
- [Heartbeat automation prompt](heartbeat-automation-prompt.md): current
  heartbeat prompt contract.
- [Quota allocation](quota-allocation.md): should-run and spend semantics.
- [Status data contract](status-data-contract.md): dashboard/status payload
  shape.
- [Public/private boundary](public-private-boundary.md): what may be committed,
  published, or retained.
- [Contributor tasks](../CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md): visible public work, sorted by
  complexity and ownership.

## Governance Rules

- Keep the `docs/` root for stable first-line product docs that contributors
  are expected to read or link from public surfaces.
- Put public-safe showcase cases, reproducible demos, and frontend-ready case
  metadata under `docs/showcases/`.
- Put benchmark dossiers, route packets, and publication planning under
  `docs/research/`.
- Put dated release-readiness packets, incident reports, and superseded
  decision records under `docs/archive/`.
- Put public launch, narrative, demo, and PR copy drafts under `docs/outreach/`.
- Put stable product-direction notes that cross individual contracts under
  `docs/product/`.
- Put machine-facing protocol contracts under `docs/reference/`.
- Every new doc should be linked from this index or from a subdirectory
  `README.md`. If it is not worth indexing, it probably belongs in local notes
  rather than the public repository.
- Prefer concise public summaries over raw logs, private trajectories, internal
  links, credentials, or local filesystem paths.
