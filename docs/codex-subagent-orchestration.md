# Codex Sub-Agent Orchestration

Goal Harness should support Codex-style work where one main controller starts
multiple sub-agents. This is useful for large repos, multi-surface validation,
and parallel exploration, but it needs a stronger contract than a single-agent
goal tick.

## Role Split

The main controller owns the goal:

- reads the active goal state,
- chooses the bounded progress segment,
- checks the goal's current compute quota before spawning or continuing child
  work,
- decides which sub-agents are worth starting,
- assigns disjoint scopes,
- integrates or rejects their results,
- writes the final run record and next action.

Sub-agents own scoped work:

- one repo question,
- one implementation slice,
- one validation surface,
- one docs or benchmark audit,
- one independent risk check.

Sub-agents should not independently redefine the goal, widen scope, force-push,
publish private state, or launch production actions.

## Dreaming / Exploration Lane

Some Codex work should not run inside the project agent that is actively
shipping changes. Broad exploration, slow memory consolidation, refactor
warnings, and cross-project pattern mining are useful, but they create scope
pressure when mixed into the delivery lane.

Goal Harness should model this as a separate dreaming / exploration lane:

- it reads run history and project state over a wider time window;
- it has its own compute quota so background exploration cannot starve delivery
  work;
- it proposes options, warnings, and memory-consolidation patches;
- it does not mutate project truth or imply user approval;
- its outputs enter the operator gate for review before becoming project work.

See [dreaming-exploration-lane.md](dreaming-exploration-lane.md) for priority,
permissions, and proposed run shape.

## When To Spawn

Spawn sub-agents when parallelism reduces uncertainty or latency:

- large repo map: split docs, code, tests, and runtime evidence;
- implementation batch: split disjoint file ownership;
- verification: run an independent check while the main controller continues;
- high-complexity adapter: let separate agents inspect TODO, docs, eval, and
  public/private boundary.

Do not spawn sub-agents for work that is tightly coupled to the next immediate
decision. If the main controller is blocked on the answer, it should usually do
that part itself.

## Handoff Contract

Every sub-agent brief should start from the shared control plane before it
describes the task. A child worker should never infer current authority from a
chat thread, an old packet, or another child's summary.

The shared control-plane handoff is `subagent_control_plane_handoff_v0`:

- `parent_goal_id` and optional `parent_run_id`,
- `authority_artifact`: the source doc, registry entry, or review packet the
  child must treat as current authority,
- `latest_state_ref`: the active-state hash, run id, or generated-at timestamp
  the child must read before work,
- `quota_gate_snapshot`: whether the parent goal is eligible, gated, waiting,
  or in focus wait,
- `evidence_boundary`: public/private boundary, allowed files, and whether the
  child may write or must stay read-only,
- `writeback_spend_contract`: who may write the final run record and spend
  quota,
- `child_decision`: one of `continue`, `wait`, or `reuse_existing_evidence`.

Only after that shared-control-plane prefix should the task brief include:

- `goal_id`,
- role: `explorer`, `worker`, or `validator`,
- scope and explicit non-goals,
- allowed files or read-only boundary,
- expected output,
- validation command if applicable,
- merge rule: what the main controller may accept, ignore, or retry.

For the lightweight shared-control-plane model, the brief or automation prompt
is also where agent scope lives. Do not stamp a scope field onto every todo.
Instead, register the agent id, give the child that `agent_id` and scope, then
have it claim only matching open todos:

```bash
goal-harness configure-goal \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --registered-agent codex-main-control \
  --registered-agent codex-side-bypass \
  --primary-agent codex-main-control \
  --execute

goal-harness todo claim \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by codex-side-bypass
```

The claim is soft ownership for visibility and conflict avoidance. It does not
replace disjoint write scopes, parent approval, quota, or user gates. The CLI
rejects unregistered claim ids so child agents learn the shared-control-plane
identity before writing. If the first executable todo is already claimed by
another agent or is outside the child's scope, the child should pick another
in-scope unclaimed todo or report that no in-scope work is available.
The controller goal should declare exactly one primary agent. Side agents use
independent git worktrees/branches for repository edits, do not merge directly,
and finish by adding a primary-agent review todo so the main controller can
review, verify, and merge.
When this becomes a server-backed pending/lease path, the contention unit should
stay per todo: one pending lease for `(goal_id, todo_id)`, not a broad lock on
the whole goal. In this context, `goal_id` is the shared control-plane lane and
`todo_id` is the work item being claimed.

The main controller owns the shared-control-plane handoff and the final
writeback. A child may produce evidence, a validation result, or a blocker, but
the controller decides whether to accept it and whether quota can be spent.

Example:

```text
subagent_control_plane_handoff_v0:
  parent_goal_id: agent-harness-main-control
  authority_artifact: review-packet generated_at=2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00
  latest_state_ref: active_state_sha256_16=0123456789abcdef
  quota_gate_snapshot: operator_gate
  evidence_boundary: read-only docs/TODO.md and docs/meta/DOC_REGISTRY.yaml
  writeback_spend_contract: child reports evidence only; parent writes and spends
  child_decision: continue

goal_id: agent-harness-main-control
role: explorer
scope: inspect docs/TODO.md and doc registry only
non_goals: do not edit files; do not inspect private prod logs
expected_output: current task clusters, likely blockers, validation surfaces
merge_rule: main controller turns this into a read-only map, not direct actions
```

## Registry Contract

Controller/sub-agent fields should stay minimal in v0.1:

```json
{
  "role": "controller",
  "parent_goal_id": null,
  "spawn_policy": {
    "mode": "multi_subagent",
    "allowed": true,
    "max_children": 3,
    "allowed_domains": ["docs-map", "validation-map", "implementation-slice"],
    "max_child_agent_turns_per_window": 3
  },
  "quota": {
    "compute": 0.5,
    "window_hours": 24,
    "max_agent_turns": 12
  },
  "coordination": {
    "registered_agents": ["codex-main-control", "codex-docs-map", "codex-validation-map", "codex-implementation-slice"],
    "primary_agent": "codex-main-control",
    "write_scope": ["docs/**", "examples/**"],
    "claim_ttl_minutes": 30,
    "requires_parent_approval": ["write", "publish", "production-action"]
  }
}
```

`spawn_policy.mode` is the control-plane execution mode. `default` means the
goal should run as a single ordinary Codex worker. `multi_subagent` means the
controller may launch child workers within `max_children`, `allowed_domains`,
and the coordination/write-scope rules. Status and quota derive the same
compact `orchestration` projection from this policy so agents do not need to
infer sub-agent permissions from chat history.

The controller goal should declare exactly one `coordination.primary_agent`.
That main agent owns final review, verification, merge, publication, and
reassignment. Child or bypass agents are side agents: they should use independent
git worktrees/branches for repository edits, should not merge directly into the
primary checkout, and should finish by adding a primary-agent review todo.

For a child goal:

```json
{
  "role": "subagent",
  "parent_goal_id": "agent-harness-main-control",
  "coordination": {
    "registered_agents": ["codex-docs-map"],
    "primary_agent": "codex-docs-map",
    "write_scope": [],
    "requires_parent_approval": ["write"]
  }
}
```

These fields describe permission and coordination expectations. They do not
turn Goal Harness into a lock service. They do make compute quota explicit so
the main controller and automations do not encode priority only through timer
cadence.

## Run Record Shape

Goal Harness run history should eventually record sub-agent activity as first
class evidence:

```json
{
  "goal_id": "agent-harness-main-control",
  "run_id": "2026-06-01T02-00-00+08-00",
  "controller": "codex-goal",
  "classification": "ready_for_parallel_probe",
  "recommended_action": "spawn docs-map and validation-map explorers",
  "subagents": [
    {
      "id": "subagent-docs-map",
      "control_plane_handoff_version": "subagent_control_plane_handoff_v0",
      "child_decision": "continue",
      "role": "explorer",
      "scope": "docs/TODO.md + doc registry",
      "status": "completed",
      "changed_files": [],
      "summary": "Found 4 task clusters and 3 validation surfaces."
    }
  ],
  "merge_decision": "accepted docs-map as evidence; no file edits",
  "next_action": "ask main controller to connect read-only adapter"
}
```

The exact schema can stay loose in v0.1, but the contract should remain stable:
the controller records who did what, why it was safe, what changed, what was
validated, and what was deliberately ignored.

Useful child-run fields:

- `run_id`,
- `parent_run_id`,
- `spawned_by_goal_id`,
- `agent_role`,
- `claim_id`,
- `work_scope`,
- `touched_paths`,
- `handoff_summary`,
- `approval_state`,
- `result_status`.

Concurrent child runs should use stable `run_id` values so history readers do
not confuse overlapping work with duplicate index records.

## Safety Rules

- Prefer read-only explorers before worker sub-agents in complex repos.
- Give workers disjoint write sets.
- Tell every worker that other agents may be editing nearby files and that it
  must not revert unrelated changes.
- Keep production, credentials, private docs, and user-specific state outside
  public run records.
- The main controller, not sub-agents, performs the final public/private scan.
- The main controller decides the final response and state writeback.

## UI Implication

A future multi-project UI should not show only one status per goal. It should
show the controller run, child sub-agent runs, and compute quota state:

```text
goal
  quota: eligible, compute=0.5, 240/720 minute-slots spent today
  controller run
    subagent: docs-map       completed
    subagent: validation-map completed
    subagent: implementation running
  merge decision
  next action
```

This keeps Codex parallelism inspectable instead of turning it into invisible
background work.
