# Project Agent Todo Contract

Project agents should keep operator-facing work out of long chat replies,
review documents, and overloaded `Next Action` paragraphs. LoopX uses
separate fields so the dashboard and quota guard can show the right work to the
right actor.

## Field Roles

- `Next Action` is one routing sentence for the next bounded step. It is not a
  reading queue, blocker dump, or checklist.
- `User Todo / Owner Review Reading Queue` is the human-facing checklist. Use
  it for concrete user, owner, or controller input that the agent cannot
  complete by itself.
- `Agent Todo` is the project-agent checklist. Use it for safe follow-up work
  the agent can do after health, operator gates, evidence, and quota allow
  execution.
- Production blockers, missing write approvals, and safety risks are gates or
  stop conditions. Do not count them as user todos unless a specific human
  action can clear them.

External boards and management surfaces, including Lark Kanban, are projections
of this contract. They may show critical status, claims, gates, evidence, and
worker handoff fields, but they should not become the place where agents invent
new task identity. A long-running Codex session can claim visible board work and
continue it; when it needs to fan out, split, supersede, or create successor
work, it writes the new task through the LoopX todo lifecycle and lets the board
sync catch up.

## Write Contract

When read-only analysis, a review packet, a gate checklist, or P0/P1 steering
finds a concrete user or owner action, write it immediately with the todo CLI.
Use `user_gate` only when the item blocks an agent or the whole goal:

```bash
loopx todo add \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role user \
  --task-class user_gate \
  --blocks-agent <agent-id> \
  --text "<public-safe blocking user or owner decision>"
```

Use `user_action` for owner-visible follow-up that should not stop unrelated
agents:

```bash
loopx todo add \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role user \
  --task-class user_action \
  --text "<public-safe non-blocking user or owner todo>"
```

Use `--role agent` for project-agent follow-up work:

```bash
loopx todo add \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role agent \
  --text "<public-safe agent action>"
```

Executable agent work should register its lane instead of relying on text
classification. Use `advancement_task` for a bounded implementation,
validation, benchmark, blocker-writeback, or repair segment:

```bash
loopx todo add \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role agent \
  --text "<public-safe executable agent action>" \
  --task-class advancement_task \
  --action-kind run_eval
```

Use `continuous_monitor` only for watch-only surfaces where an unchanged poll
must stay quiet:

```bash
loopx todo add \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role agent \
  --text "<public-safe monitor action>" \
  --task-class continuous_monitor \
  --action-kind monitor
```

`--action-kind` is a public-safe token. Known generic tokens such as
`run_eval`, `validate`, `rebuild`, `writeback`, `monitor`, and `poll` help the
CLI project the lane consistently, but explicit `--task-class` is the authority
when both are present. If an exact todo already exists, `todo add` updates or
inserts the metadata comment instead of creating a duplicate checkbox.
`--task-class user_gate`, `--task-class user_action`, and `--task-class blocker`
are non-executable control lanes; quota/executor code must not treat them as
advancement work. Open user todos must declare either `user_gate` or
`user_action`; a bare `--role user` todo is an authoring error.

For scheduled monitors, keep the contract minimal: `--next-due-at` is the first
eligible time, `--cadence` is the retry interval, `--monitor-target-key` is the
stable idempotency key, and optional `--expires-at` is the hard stop after
which the monitor must not catch up.

Terminology: a `goal_id` is the LoopX control-plane boundary: registry
entry, active-state file, quota lane, status projection, and run-history stream.
A `todo_id` is a structured work item inside that goal. LoopX does not
currently model issues as a separate runtime object.

Multiple agents may share the same project control plane. A todo can carry a
soft owner with `claimed_by`, but ordinary agent todos should not restate the
agent's broad prompt scope. Scope belongs in the automation prompt or sub-agent
handoff; the agent uses that scope to decide which open todo it may claim.
User-gate todos are different: when a user decision only unlocks one registered
agent or lane, record the blocked agent explicitly with `blocks_agent` so quota
does not stop unrelated agents. For convenience, `todo add/update --role user
--task-class user_gate --agent-id <agent>` defaults `blocks_agent` to that agent
when `--blocks-agent` is omitted. In multi-agent goals, open `user_gate` todos
must have exactly one explicit scope: either `blocks_agent=<registered-agent>`
for a lane-scoped decision or `global_gate=true` / `--global-gate` for a
genuine goal-wide owner gate. Unscoped multi-agent user gates are an authoring
error because every registered agent would otherwise see another lane's
question as its own stop condition.

When a user gate only blocks one concrete action, add the blocked todo id with
`unblocks_todo_id=<todo_id>`. When multiple todos share the same broad
`action_kind`, use the schema-backed decision-scope fields instead of relying
on title/body token overlap:

```bash
loopx todo add \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role user \
  --task-class user_gate \
  --agent-id codex-main-control \
  --decision-scope direction:action:benchmark_target_choice \
  --text "Choose the benchmark target before running that case."

loopx todo update \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <agent-todo-id> \
  --required-decision-scope direction:action:benchmark_target_choice
```

Quota treats a gate as covering an agent todo when `decision_scope` matches or
dominates one of that todo's `required_decision_scopes`; otherwise the todo is
independent and can be selected as a safe fallback when the boundary permits it.

Each shared goal declares `coordination.agent_model=peer_v1` and a
`coordination.registered_agents` set. Registration grants identity, not rank.
Work authority comes from `claimed_by`, task leases, the goal/write boundary,
and typed continuation policy. Functional profile roles and scope summaries are
advisory; they do not make one identity the default reviewer or leader.

Ordinary lifecycle mutations follow todo ownership. A goal may separately
delegate narrow cross-owner actions to an orchestration agent:

```yaml
coordination:
  todo_lifecycle_authority:
    - agent_id: codex-main-control
      actions: [complete, reassign, supersede]
      requires_reason: true
```

Configure the equivalent registry value without hand-editing state:

```bash
loopx configure-goal \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-lifecycle-authority-json \
  '{"agent_id":"codex-main-control","actions":["complete","reassign","supersede"],"requires_reason":true}' \
  --execute
```

The delegated agent must already be registered. Each override is action-scoped
and emits a typed receipt containing the actor, original owner, authority
source, and public-safe `--authority-reason`. Delegation never bypasses an
explicit `excluded_agents` boundary. `coordination.supervisor` remains a
proposal-only observation role and does not imply lifecycle authority.

```bash
loopx todo complete \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo-id> \
  --agent-id codex-main-control \
  --authority-reason "Verified the result and closed the stalled lane." \
  --evidence "<public-safe evidence>"
```

An agent todo can name a different task repository without copying agent scope
into todo metadata:

```bash
loopx todo update \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role agent \
  --todo-id <todo-id> \
  --task-repository git:github.com/owner/repo
```

`task_repository` is a first-class, credential-free Git identity. It routes
workspace isolation, not write authority; claim/lease, capabilities, the goal
boundary, and repository policy continue to apply.

`quota should-run --agent-id <agent-id>` is the preflight for every peer. When
the selected task writes repository state and the peer is in a non-git,
unrelated, or non-isolated workspace, it returns `workspace_guard` and blocks
normal delivery until that peer moves to an independent worktree and reruns the
guard. Read-only and monitor-only work does not require isolation merely because
of agent identity. When `task_repository` is absent, the registered goal repo is
still the expected repository, so an unrelated worktree cannot bypass the goal
repository rule.

Contributor-facing example:

```bash
loopx --format json quota should-run \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --agent-id codex-peer-b
```

If the response includes
`effective_action=agent_workspace_repair`, the peer should not edit files yet.
Create or switch to a separate worktree and rerun the same guard:

```bash
git worktree add /tmp/<goal-id>-peer-b -b codex/<peer-branch>
cd /tmp/<goal-id>-peer-b
loopx --format json quota should-run \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --agent-id codex-peer-b
```

Only after that rerun returns normal delivery should the peer claim an in-scope
todo and edit repository files. A todo claimed by another peer remains owned by
that peer until explicit transfer. For agent-specific quota payloads, current
agent claims are preferred, unclaimed todos remain selectable, and other-peer
claims are diagnostic context rather than executable work. This reduces
collisions without writing broad prompt scope into todo metadata or pretending
that a soft claim is already a hard lease. When a runnable current-agent or unclaimed
advancement todo exists, quota may also expose
`agent_lane_next_action.schema_version=agent_lane_next_action_v0`. That field is
the peer's current slice for this turn; it does not overwrite the durable
goal-level `Next Action`. `loopx status --agent-id <agent-id>` may attach the same derived field to matching status
queue items for observation, while leaving the project-level route unchanged.
When a candidate has `target_capabilities` and missing target bridge
capabilities, quota may mark it `capability_repair_mode=true`; scoped
next-action selection should prefer that repair-mode candidate over ordinary
runnable work in the same claim/priority bucket so capability-building todos do
not require fragile active-state reordering.

Deferred todos may carry a machine-readable resume condition with
`resume_when=<token>`. Supported conditions are:

- `resume_when=todo_done:<todo_id>`: the deferred todo becomes a successor
  replan candidate after the referenced todo reaches `status=done`.
- `resume_when=pr_merged:#532` or
  `resume_when=pr_merged:owner/repo#532`: the deferred todo becomes a successor
  candidate after a structured rollout event records that PR merge. An
  unqualified `#532` is bound only to the todo's GitHub `task_repository`; use
  the qualified form for cross-repository dependencies. If LoopX cannot derive
  that binding, it keeps the todo deferred and exposes a machine-readable
  repository ambiguity instead of matching the same PR number in another
  repository.

Open todos may also carry `resume_when` when they are visible but not yet
executable. Until the parsed `resume_condition.satisfied` value is true, status
and quota keep the todo out of `first_executable_items`,
`executable_backlog_items`, `capability_gate.runnable_candidates`, and
`agent_lane_next_action`. When `resume_ready=true`, the open todo may enter the
normal executable lane for its claimed agent.

Status and quota expose deferred todos as a visibility lane after sorted open
todo lanes. This is a deferred gate-resume lane: it is not runnable work, and
it is not evidence that the current agent has no todo, until an agent reopens,
supersedes, or records a no-follow-up rationale for the deferred item.

```bash
loopx register-agent \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --agent-id codex-main-control \
  --agent-id codex-side-bypass \
  --execute
```

Then claim through the dedicated command. `--claimed-by` records the durable
owner, while `--agent-id` attributes the peer performing this mutation. For a
self-claim they are both required and must name the same registered agent:

```bash
loopx todo claim \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by codex-main-control \
  --agent-id codex-main-control
```

Old projects that do not yet have `coordination.registered_agents` are
intentionally blocked when an agent tries to claim work. The CLI error includes
the `register-agent --agent-id <agent-id> --execute` command so the agent or
controller can register its identity before writing ownership metadata. Agent
registration writes the source registry named by the global projection; if the
shared global registry is not writable, it fails before changing that source so
the control plane does not drift into a half-registered state.

Use `--clear-claim` when an owning peer reassigns a todo or releases work.
`claimed_by` is visibility, not a runtime lease: it does not bypass quota, user
gates, write-scope checks, validation, or actor authorization. On registered
multi-agent goals, `todo claim/update/complete/supersede` require `--agent-id`;
the actor must not be excluded and must match the current `claimed_by` owner
when one exists. An exact linked `user_gate` decision scope is the narrow
exception: its typed approve/reject/cancel completion is attributed to the
owner/controller decision instead of an agent actor. Old projects without
`coordination.registered_agents` still fail closed before ownership metadata
can be written.
`todo claim` is non-destructive: if another registered agent already owns the
todo, it fails closed instead of silently replacing `claimed_by`. Transfer
ownership with an explicit `todo update --clear-claim` or
`todo update --claimed-by <agent-id>` decision. The CLI writes claim changes and
completion handoffs under the same active-state file lock as todo
add/update/complete, so concurrent CLI writers re-read the latest state before
editing instead of overwriting a stale snapshot.

The command resolves the active state from the project registry, creates the
canonical section when needed, updates `updated_at`, and avoids duplicate exact
todo text. If a dashboard or controller needs the new checklist immediately,
refresh the status projection after the write:

```bash
loopx refresh-state --goal-id <goal-id> --agent-id <registered-agent>
```

For multi-agent goals, `refresh-state` requires an explicit `--agent-id`.
The default scoped refresh is an agent-lane run: it is useful for keeping the
same turn's writeback/accounting identity intact, but it does not replace the
goal-level status route.

## Lifecycle Contract

Agents should not patch active-state checkboxes directly to move work forward.
Use the lifecycle commands so LoopX can preserve `todo_id`, status,
classification metadata, timestamps, and idempotency in one write.

Todo lifecycle should stay simple. Do not add a separate feature state machine
such as `slice_done`, `rolled_out`, or `proven_in_product_path` unless the
product has a concrete UI/runtime need for it. For ordinary project work, use
**todo succession** instead: complete the implementation slice, then create the
next concrete todo for rollout, product-path audit, benchmark proof, docs,
telemetry, or operator decision.

A non-trivial feature todo is done only as a slice. Before or during completion,
the agent should do one of two things:

- create the next public-safe agent or user todo with `--next-agent-todo`,
  `--next-user-todo`, or a follow-up `todo add`;
- record a compact no-follow-up rationale with `--no-follow-up` plus `--note`
  / `--reason` / `--evidence`, explaining why the feature is truly finished
  and does not need rollout, audit, docs, or product-path proof.

This keeps the active checklist honest without making LoopX a heavyweight
project-management state machine.

Complete the current todo and atomically register the next executable todo:

```bash
loopx todo complete \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --agent-id <registered-agent> \
  --evidence "<public-safe artifact or result>" \
  --next-agent-todo "<public-safe next executable action>" \
  --next-task-class advancement_task \
  --next-action-kind run_eval
```

Human review is not automatically an execution gate. When a validated feature
PR can wait for review while independent work continues, atomically derive a
bound reminder and a runnable successor:

```bash
loopx todo complete \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by <registered-agent> \
  --agent-id <registered-agent> \
  --evidence "<validated PR URL and checks>" \
  --next-user-todo "Review the validated feature PR." \
  --next-user-task-class user_action \
  --next-agent-todo "Continue the next independent feature slice." \
  --next-claimed-by <registered-agent>
```

`--next-user-todo` defaults to `user_gate` for backward compatibility. Select
`user_action` explicitly for a reminder that stays visible without setting
`blocks_agent`. Add a separate `continuous_monitor` todo when the PR lifecycle
needs periodic readback. Reserve `user_gate` for an exact owner/controller
authority boundary such as merging an aggregate branch into `main`, release,
benchmark launch, credentials, or protected production action.

For an experimental feature stack, a stable integration branch may collect
small feature PRs while review reminders remain open. Each feature still uses a
dedicated worktree and branch; its PR targets the integration branch. The
aggregate integration-branch PR to `main` is the review/merge boundary. This
keeps review latency from suspending unrelated work without weakening the final
delivery gate.

Terminal PR state does not silently complete a review reminder: merged PRs may
still need post-merge review. When the owner explicitly acknowledges that an
exact review action is complete, persist a typed acknowledgement receipt with
the exact bound `user_action` and GitHub PR:

```bash
loopx issue-fix pr-review-ack \
  --url https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <review-todo-id> \
  --agent-id <bound-agent> \
  --owner-acknowledged
```

The receipt is fail-closed, idempotent per todo revision, and read back after
append. It binds the goal, todo revision, agent, provider, repository, PR
number, and canonical permalink without parsing reminder prose. Reopening or
materially editing the todo invalidates the prior acknowledgement.

Use `pr-review-reconcile` as the single reconciliation path. It may be invoked
explicitly or by a due `continuous_monitor` through any scheduler or host
adapter. Supplying `--owner-acknowledged` first records the same typed receipt.
Reconciliation validates the current todo revision before provider access and
again before completion, then closes the reminder only for the exact terminal
PR. A missing receipt, stale revision, unavailable provider, or unsupported
forge leaves the reminder open. Quota projection has no provider side effects.

If an agent takes ownership at completion time, include the claim in the same
locked lifecycle write:

```bash
loopx todo complete \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by codex-peer-a \
  --agent-id codex-peer-a \
  --evidence "<public-safe artifact or result>" \
  --next-agent-todo "Continue the next bounded task." \
  --next-claimed-by codex-peer-b \
  --next-continuation-policy independent_handoff
```

LoopX does not infer continuation authority from agent identity. `action_kind`
remains an open domain token describing the work. The closed
`continuation_policy` enum describes only the relationship between the completed
task and its successor:

- `independent_handoff` is the default. The successor stays unclaimed unless
  `--next-claimed-by` selects a registered peer;
- `same_agent_non_delivery` keeps an evidence-backed non-delivery continuation
  with the completing peer.

Review, verification, merge, and publication remain ordinary `action_kind`
values. They do not alter scheduler ordering. Use `independent_handoff` for a
successor that another peer may claim, and add one or more `excluded_agents`
only when executor separation is required. `claimed_by` may not name an
excluded peer.

`same_agent_non_delivery` is intentionally structural rather than
review-specific. It covers readiness checks, audits, triage, and other
non-delivery continuations when explicitly selected. LoopX does not infer it
from `action_kind`, and it does not authorize repository delivery or bypass
successor quota/capability checks.

A handoff becomes a blocking dependency only when it carries both
`unblocks_todo_id` and executor exclusions. Ordinary independent successors do
not inherit an owner implicitly. Use `--next-claimed-by` when the next owner is
already known; leave the successor unclaimed when a later claim should select
it.

For small changes that satisfy the repository's self-merge rules, a peer may
self-merge and complete without a successor review todo by making the
exception explicit:

```bash
loopx todo complete \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by codex-peer-a \
  --agent-id codex-peer-a \
  --self-merged \
  --evidence "<public-safe commit, validation, and self-merge summary>"
```

`--self-merged` requires `--evidence`. Do not use it for runtime,
benchmark, permission, production, destructive git, publication, public
evidence-policy, or broad coordination changes that need an independent
handoff.
After a validated self-merge, write back the real delivery outcome at the
project level when the slice advanced the public product or case path. An
agent-lane refresh with `--agent-id` records peer-local notes; a goal-scope
refresh records the durable goal route. Both require a registered peer. Do
not append a follow-up goal-level `surface_only` sync after a validated
`outcome_progress` slice; either skip the duplicate sync or mirror the product
progress with:

```bash
loopx refresh-state \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --classification <public-safe-progress-classification> \
  --delivery-batch-scale multi_surface \
  --delivery-outcome outcome_progress \
  --agent-id <registered-agent> \
  --progress-scope goal
```

This keeps validated peer product work from being misread as another
surface-only heartbeat turn.
When a self-merged slice has an obvious same-scope continuation, it may also
atomically add that successor todo and claim it back to the same peer:

```bash
loopx todo complete \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --claimed-by codex-peer-a \
  --agent-id codex-peer-a \
  --self-merged \
  --evidence "<public-safe commit, validation, and self-merge summary>" \
  --next-agent-todo "Continue the next small docs/productization slice." \
  --next-claimed-by codex-peer-a
```

Without `--self-merged`, no implicit review route is created. For independent
review, use `--next-action-kind review --next-continuation-policy
independent_handoff`; add `--next-excluded-agent <author>` only when the review
must remain open to multiple peers while excluding the author. When that
successor belongs to a specific repository or needs execution capabilities,
set `--next-task-repository <git:host/path>` and repeat
`--next-required-capability <capability>` in the same completion command. The
successor is then fully routable before its executor exclusions take effect.

Use `todo update` for lower-level, non-terminal status changes:

```bash
loopx todo update \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --agent-id <registered-agent> \
  --status blocked \
  --reason "<public-safe blocker>" \
  --task-class blocker
```

Agent Todo completion always goes through `todo complete`; `todo update
--status done` is rejected so review, successor, and no-follow-up policy cannot
be bypassed. An evidence-backed peer
`continuous_monitor` with no required write scope may close with
`todo complete --no-follow-up` when its bounded watch ends without a material
transition. This closeout records `self_merged=false` and does not
create a successor review todo for observation-only work.

Use `--resume-when` when deferring a successor that should wake up after a
machine-readable condition instead of living only in prose:

```bash
loopx todo update \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --agent-id <registered-agent> \
  --status deferred \
  --resume-when todo_done:<blocking_todo_id> \
  --reason "<public-safe deferred rationale>"
```

Use `todo supersede` when the current open todo should be retired and replaced:

```bash
loopx todo supersede \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo_id> \
  --agent-id <registered-agent> \
  --reason "<public-safe reason>" \
  --next-agent-todo "<replacement executable action>"
```

If the superseded todo was claimed, the replacement inherits that `claimed_by`.
If it carried `blocks_agent` / `unblocks_todo_id`, the replacement inherits
those unblock fields too. Use `--next-claimed-by <agent-id>` to make a handoff
explicit.

`todo complete` and `todo supersede` are intentionally idempotent for repeated
heartbeats: if the old todo is already complete and the next todo already
exists with the same metadata, the command returns `changed=false` and does not
duplicate the next checkbox. `todo archive-completed` is only a hygiene command:
it moves already-completed active todos into `Completed Work Archive`; it does
not mark open todos as done.

## Parsed Schema

Projects may keep writing ordinary Markdown checkboxes, but readers should use
the structured projection emitted by status/quota when available. Todo summaries
carry `schema_version=todo_summary_v0`; individual items carry
`schema_version=todo_item_v0`, `todo_id`, `role`, `status`, `priority`,
`title`, `archive_state`, `source_section`, `index`, `text`, `task_class`, and
optional `action_kind`, `claimed_by`, `required_capabilities`, and
`target_capabilities`. `action_kind` is extensible; optional
`continuation_policy` is limited to `independent_handoff`,
or `same_agent_non_delivery`. Agent todos may also carry `excluded_agents`,
`unblocks_todo_id`, and `no_followup=true` to express executor separation,
dependency lineage, and intentional closeout. `blocks_agent` is reserved for
scoping user gates.

After a hard-cut upgrade, `loopx check` reports agent todos that still carry
removed gate-routing fields. New readers also preserve a read-only
`removed_continuation_policy` diagnostic for legacy `review_handoff` and
`primary_review` records and exclude those records from claim/quota execution.
This fail-closed compatibility marker is not a supported continuation type and
is never written back. Repair legacy review records explicitly:

```bash
loopx todo update \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --todo-id <todo-id> \
  --agent-id <registered-agent> \
  --role agent \
  --continuation-policy independent_handoff \
  --excluded-agent <author>
```

For removed `blocks_agent` routing, use `loopx todo update --todo-id <todo_id>
--role agent --clear-blocks-agent`. LoopX does not infer the excluded author or
rewrite either form automatically.

Deferred successors may carry `resume_when`, `resume_condition`, and
`resume_ready`; `resume_ready=true` means the deferred item should be considered
for a successor replan before any agent-scoped no-candidate wait, not that
normal delivery may skip the todo lifecycle. A ready deferred successor also
preempts a strictly lower-priority open advancement todo for this lifecycle
replan. It does not preempt an equal-priority open todo, and it never enters the
normal executable backlog until a lifecycle command reopens it.
The `todo_id` is first-class when written by the CLI.
`claimed_by` values are normalized public-safe agent ids and should correspond to
`coordination.registered_agents`. Legacy Markdown without metadata still gets a
parser-derived compatibility id from local section/index/text, and the first
lifecycle command will materialize that id back into metadata. Future lease
timestamps, dependency, capability detail, and evidence-link fields should
extend this item shape instead of adding another todo format.
In Markdown, lane metadata is stored as an indented HTML comment directly under
the checkbox, for example:

```markdown
- [ ] Run one validated benchmark case and write back result or blocker.
  <!-- loopx:todo todo_id=todo_8e280be49441 status=open task_class=advancement_task action_kind=run_eval required_capabilities=shell%2Cbenchmark_runner claimed_by=codex-main-control -->
```

Plain checkbox text remains a compatibility fallback. New automation-facing
work should prefer the CLI metadata path so quota and dashboard consumers do
not need project-specific word lists.

Executable agent todos may declare per-todo environment needs with
`--required-capability`. Keep this field near the todo, not in a global agent
profile: the same agent may have shell/filesystem capability for docs work, but
lack `benchmark_runner`, `external_evidence_poll`, `network`, or another bridge
for a specific step.

```bash
loopx todo add \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role agent \
  --text "<public-safe executable agent action>" \
  --task-class advancement_task \
  --action-kind run_eval \
  --required-capability shell \
  --required-capability benchmark_runner
```

Use `--target-capability` when the todo is meant to build, repair,
materialize, or parity-check a capability rather than use that capability as a
prerequisite. For example, a benchmark product-path parity todo can hard-require
only shell while targeting the benchmark runner bridge:

```bash
loopx todo add \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --role agent \
  --text "<public-safe benchmark parity repair action>" \
  --task-class advancement_task \
  --action-kind benchmark_treatment_product_path_parity \
  --required-capability shell \
  --target-capability benchmark_runner
```

`status` projects `required_capabilities` on every visible todo. `quota
should-run` then derives a read-only `capability_gate` from the visible
executable queue, not from a single preselected todo. With multiple P0 or P1
items, it scans the projected queue in order and exposes the candidate set:
capability-satisfied todos appear in `capability_gate.runnable_candidates`,
while blocked higher-priority candidates remain visible in
`capability_gate.blocked_candidates`. The gate does not choose the final todo;
the agent keeps decision authority and must pick from the runnable set during
its steering audit. If no visible executable candidate can run, the gate returns
`repair_bridge`, `ask_owner`, or `skip` according to the missing capability
class.
`target_capabilities` stay visible in runnable candidate payloads. If a target
bridge is absent, the candidate is annotated with `capability_repair_mode=true`
and `missing_target_capabilities`, but that target is not treated as a hard
execution blocker.

## Execution Order

1. Run the quota guard against the shared global registry before spending
   automatic delivery compute.
2. If the guard or review packet exposes open user todos, surface them to the
   user instead of reporting "no new user action".
3. If the guard sets `notify_user_on_open_todo=true`, treat the open todos as a
   blocker-push notification: ask at most three items, skip delivery work, and
   skip quota spend unless the same blocker was already surfaced recently.
4. Do not execute `agent_command`, adapter work, write-control, or production
   actions while the relevant gate is still unresolved.
5. After the user todo is completed or explicitly deferred, the project agent
   may continue only through the safe path allowed by the current guard or
   review packet.

## Public Smokes

Two dependency-free public fixtures cover this contract:

```bash
python3 examples/control_plane/todo-cli-smoke.py
python3 examples/control_plane/todo-lifecycle-cli-smoke.py
python3 examples/project/project-agent-adoption-smoke.py
python3 examples/control_plane/todo-concurrent-write-lock-smoke.py
python3 examples/capability-gate-smoke.py
```

The first verifies the todo CLI writes canonical active-state sections. The
second verifies lifecycle transitions by `todo_id`, including claimed
completion, supersede, idempotent next-todo insertion, and non-executable
blocker lanes.
The third verifies an executor-facing path from quota guard hint, to user todo
write, to status projection, to approved project-agent handoff.
The fourth verifies concurrent todo writers wait on the active-state lock and
preserve both claim metadata and unrelated updates.
The fifth verifies per-todo `required_capabilities`, including multiple P0/P1
candidate selection, bridge repair, and owner-gated capability misses.
