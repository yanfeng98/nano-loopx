# Codex CLI Packaged Install Path

Status: early product path.

Goal Harness should be easy to adopt from the tool the user already has open.
For Codex CLI users, the first successful path is:

1. Open Codex CLI TUI in a project repo.
2. Paste one Goal Harness start message.
3. If `goal-harness` is missing, let the agent run the no-clone installer.
4. Return to the same TUI with current goal, gate, todo, and next safe action.

The user should not have to clone this repository before learning whether Goal
Harness helps their project.

## Current User Path

For a fresh machine, the installer can be run without a manual clone:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness/main/scripts/install-from-github.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
goal-harness doctor
```

The installer downloads a GitHub archive, creates a stable local release
snapshot under `~/.local/share/goal-harness/releases/`, installs the
`goal-harness` wrapper under `~/.local/bin`, and installs the reusable Codex
skills under `~/.codex/skills`.

It intentionally skips `goal-harness-canary` by default because there is no
durable live checkout in this mode. Contributors who want a canary should clone
the repository and run `scripts/install-local.sh`.

## Codex CLI TUI Message

The agent-first start message can now be stricter about install repair:

```text
Start Goal Harness for this repo. If `goal-harness` is missing, install it with
the official no-clone GitHub installer, then connect this project. Show me the
current goal, concrete user gate if any, top todos, and next safe action before
running longer work. Keep me in this Codex CLI TUI unless I explicitly accept a
headless fallback.
```

This keeps the product hierarchy clear:

- first run: one visible TUI message;
- install repair: no manual clone required;
- recurring automation: separate driver work;
- contributor development: clone plus canary remains available.

## Update Path

For users installed through the archive script, update is the same command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness/main/scripts/install-from-github.sh | bash
goal-harness doctor
```

Each run creates a new timestamped release snapshot and repoints
`~/.local/bin/goal-harness` to it. This is intentionally conservative: existing
runtime state stays under `~/.codex/goal-harness`, while the executable and
skills are refreshed together.

## Contributor Path

For contributors and side agents working on Goal Harness itself, keep using a
real checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness ~/goal-harness
~/goal-harness/scripts/install-local.sh
goal-harness doctor
goal-harness-canary doctor
```

That path installs both the stable release wrapper and a live canary wrapper,
which is useful for validating local changes before promotion.

## Future Packaging

The no-clone archive installer is the first bridge. A mature release channel
should later add:

- a signed or checksum-pinned release archive;
- `pipx install goal-harness` or `uv tool install goal-harness` after package
  publishing is ready;
- a Homebrew formula for macOS users;
- a small update command that reports current release id, latest available
  release, and installed skill freshness.

Do not make these future channels block the current Codex CLI TUI path. The
first product win is that a user can paste one message and get a working local
control plane without leaving the repo.
