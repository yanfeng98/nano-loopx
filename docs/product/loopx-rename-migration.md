# LoopX Rename Migration

Status: active migration plan.

LoopX is the canonical product name and `loopx` is the canonical CLI command.
The rename is intentionally fail-fast at the product surface: new installs and
generated prompts expose only `loopx`, so old command names cannot silently hide
missed migration work.

## Canonical Contract

- Product name: `LoopX`.
- CLI command: `loopx`.
- Legacy CLI command: none. `goal-harness` is not installed as an alias.
- Python package/import: `loopx`.
- Local project state: `.loopx/registry.json`.
- Global runtime state: `~/.codex/loopx`.
- Skill names: `loopx-project`, `loopx-doc-registry`, and
  `loopx-self-repair`.

## Migration Todo Batches

1. P0 canonical contract: document the no-legacy-alias surface and rename
   package/import/state/skill namespaces.
2. P0 CLI/install migration: install only `loopx`, update package metadata,
   installers, and install smokes.
3. P0 public docs migration: move the root README, getting-started path, and
   packaged install docs to LoopX language.
4. P0 state migration SOP: ship the explicit one-shot
   [`migrate-state`](./loopx-state-migration-sop.md) path for existing local
   users. This is not a legacy CLI compatibility alias; it is an auditable
   dry-run-first import into `.loopx` and `~/.codex/loopx`.
5. P1 external surface release gate: update package publish metadata, hosted
   Pages URLs, external docs, and any release notes that cannot be validated
   until the canonical code rename has landed.
6. P1 GitHub rename gate: rename `huangruiteng/goal-harness` to
   `huangruiteng/loopx` only after the canonical rename PR lands and the
   maintainer accepts the public URL migration plan. The no-clone installer
   points at the new repo URL, so the GitHub rename is a merge/release gate,
   not an optional cleanup.

## GitHub Rename Gate

The current authenticated GitHub user has admin permission on the existing
`huangruiteng/goal-harness` repository. Codex should perform the final rename
to `huangruiteng/loopx` only after an explicit maintainer gate.

Do not rename the repository as part of an ordinary code PR. Before the rename:

- merge the LoopX canonical rename PR;
- confirm the no-clone installer works from the new URL;
- decide the hosted Pages URL strategy;
- update repository description/topics;
- update local remotes after rename with `git remote set-url origin`;
- keep the old repository name unused so GitHub redirects are not invalidated.

GitHub redirects renamed repository web and git traffic, including clone, fetch,
and push operations, but repository Pages URLs are an exception and GitHub
Actions that use an action from a renamed repository do not follow the rename.
That makes Pages and action-consumer references explicit checklist items.

## Validation Matrix

Required before the rename PR is considered ready:

- `python3 -m py_compile $(find loopx examples -name '*.py' -print)`
- `python3 examples/install-local-smoke.py`
- `python3 examples/codex-cli-packaged-install-smoke.py`
- `python3 examples/fresh-clone-quickstart-smoke.py`
- `python3 examples/state-migration-smoke.py`
- `python3 examples/docs-governance-smoke.py`
- `loopx check --scan-root .`
- `git diff --check`

Self-use validation should install from the working tree into an isolated home,
run `loopx doctor`, bootstrap a temporary project, and confirm quota/status
work through `.loopx` and `~/.codex/loopx`.
