# Codex CLI Live TUI First-Message Pilot

Status: blocker recorded; manual TUI bootstrap remains primary.
Recorded: 2026-06-21.

This note records a real Codex CLI TUI pilot for the one-message Goal Harness
bootstrap path. The pilot used only a disposable public-safe repo and kept raw
TUI output, Codex transcripts, session files, credentials, and private project
paths out of the repository.

## Question

Can Goal Harness launch a real visible Codex CLI TUI with the generated start
message and prove that the loop starts, remains observable, and stays steerable
by the user?

## Method

The pilot used a temporary public repo with a small `README.md`, a small
`GOAL.md`, and a generated start message:

```bash
goal-harness codex-cli-bootstrap-message \
  --project /tmp/goal-harness-live-tui-pilot.<suffix> \
  --goal-id public-live-tui-pilot-goal \
  --agent-id codex-side-bypass \
  --message-only
```

The local Codex CLI surface was `codex-cli 0.142.0-alpha.7`. Its help exposed:

- `codex [OPTIONS] [PROMPT]`;
- `--no-alt-screen`;
- `--cd <DIR>`;
- `resume`;
- `remote-control`.

Two bounded probes were attempted:

1. `codex doctor` from the disposable repo. It did not produce bounded output
   before manual interrupt.
2. A real TUI launch with a public-safe generated message:

   ```bash
   codex --no-alt-screen --ask-for-approval never --sandbox workspace-write \
     -C /tmp/goal-harness-live-tui-pilot.<suffix> \
     "$(cat goal-harness-start-message.txt)"
   ```

The second probe launched Codex CLI, but it did not produce a compact,
machine-checkable first-response result in the bounded capture window. The
process was still active afterward and was stopped by exact temp-repo process
match.

## Result

Not proven yet.

The generated message can start a real Codex CLI TUI through `codex [PROMPT]`,
but the current automation-side proof is insufficient for claiming that the
Goal Harness loop started successfully.

Observed blockers:

- no bounded first-response or completion marker;
- capture output exceeded the automation budget before a compact result was
  available;
- the TUI process remained active after the capture window;
- passing the generated message as `[PROMPT]` exposes the prompt in the process
  command line, which is acceptable only for this public-safe pilot and should
  not become the default path for real project repos.

Decision:

`live_tui_first_message_blocked_by_bounded_visible_completion_missing`

## Product Implication

The public user path should still be:

1. the user opens Codex CLI TUI in the project repo;
2. the user pastes one Goal Harness start message;
3. Codex keeps the visible TUI as the live control surface.

Goal Harness should not advertise automated `codex [PROMPT]` launch as a
verified first-run path until a bounded visible pilot adapter exists.

That adapter needs to prove all of these without raw transcript or session-file
reads:

- inject or paste the start message without leaking project-specific prompt
  text through process arguments;
- observe a compact public-safe first-response marker;
- stop or idle-check the TUI without racing the user;
- show that the user can still steer, review, interrupt, or take over;
- write compact success evidence or a precise blocker before quota spend.

## Follow-Up

Create a bounded visible pilot adapter before promoting live TUI automation:

```text
[P0] Codex CLI bounded visible pilot adapter: define and test a minimal
public-safe first-response capture and stop protocol for Codex CLI TUI bootstrap
before claiming live TUI first-message success; avoid raw transcripts, session
files, credentials, private paths, and argv prompt leakage.
```

Until then, keep the no-clone installer, generated paste message, and
transcript-free smoke bundle as the reliable first-run route.

## Bounded Adapter Command

The follow-up adapter is public-safe and packet-only: it validates a compact
first-response fixture plus runtime-idle evidence, but it does not start Codex,
read transcripts, read session files, capture stdout/stderr, or mutate the TUI.

```bash
goal-harness codex-cli-bounded-visible-pilot-adapter \
  --project /tmp/goal-harness-live-tui-pilot.<suffix> \
  --goal-id public-live-tui-pilot-goal \
  --agent-id codex-side-bypass \
  --first-response-fixture public-first-response.json \
  --idle-fixture public-runtime-idle.json
```

The first-response fixture must prove the visible TUI showed the goal id, user
gate or none, top user todo or none, selected agent todo, and next safe action;
it must also prove the user can interrupt or take over, compact writeback is
planned before quota spend, and the bootstrap prompt was not passed as an argv
prompt. If any piece is missing, the pilot stays a precise blocker instead of a
success claim.

## Visible Capture Plan

Use this packet before a real user-visible rehearsal:

```bash
goal-harness codex-cli-visible-first-response-capture-plan \
  --project /tmp/goal-harness-live-tui-pilot.<suffix> \
  --goal-id public-live-tui-pilot-goal \
  --agent-id codex-side-bypass
```

It prints the copy-first procedure, stop conditions, and sample
`public-first-response.json` / `public-runtime-idle.json` shapes. The user still
starts in the Codex CLI TUI and pastes the generated message; the packet only
tells the operator which public-safe booleans to record before running the
bounded adapter. It never runs Codex, reads terminal output, reads session files,
or accepts an argv prompt path as success evidence.
