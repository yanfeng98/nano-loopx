# Server-Client Product Shape

This note describes a medium-term product shape for Goal Harness. It is not an
implementation spec for a network service. The purpose is to name the product
roles clearly enough that future CLI, dashboard, Lark, MCP, and server work can
share one mental model.

Goal Harness is the control plane around agent loops:

- the server owns durable goal state, event history, and governed planning
  lanes;
- the client acts as the user's intent proxy;
- executor loops do bounded work and write back evidence.

## Product Roles

### Server

The Goal Harness server is the durable control-plane owner. It should be
thought of first as a database-backed state system, not as the place where
agent intelligence lives. In local-first mode, this may still be implemented
by files plus CLI commands. In the product shape, however, the server is where
long-running facts become coherent:

- stable goal identity, current belief, todo state, gate state, and run
  history;
- registered agent identity, role, scope, worktree policy, and review handoff
  defaults;
- per-todo claim and future lease state;
- quota, spend, idempotency, and concurrency policy;
- compact public/private boundary summaries;
- scheduled planning, dreaming, and replanning queues;
- proposal promotion from advisory lanes into normal user or agent todos.

The backend layer around that store should be thin but strict: typed reads,
idempotent writes, conflict checks, compact projections, scheduler decisions,
and public/private boundary enforcement. It is closer to a control-plane
database plus projection API than to a traditional application server that
owns domain behavior.

The server should stay conservative. Planning lanes may rank candidate todos,
surface refactor warnings, or propose evidence probes, but they do not execute
protected work, read private material, or spend delivery quota until promoted
through the normal gate, quota, and boundary path.

### Delivery And Planning Queues

The server roadmap should separate two queue families while keeping them in the
same durable state system:

- **Delivery queue**: promoted user or agent todos that an executor may work on
  after `quota should-run`, claim or lease checks, workspace policy, capability
  checks, and goal-boundary checks.
- **Planning queue**: dreaming, periodic replan, memory consolidation, and
  refactor-warning proposals that may inspect compact run history and rank
  candidate work, but remain advisory until promoted.

Both queues should share the boring control-plane substrate: per-goal locks,
per-todo or per-proposal identity, idempotency keys, append-only events,
public/private boundary summaries, and compact status projections. They should
not share delivery permission. A planning proposal can say "this todo should
move up", "this stale lane needs a split", or "this blocker should be asked";
it cannot silently mutate active truth, claim delivery work, read gated
material, or spend delivery quota.

Promotion is the critical transition:

```text
planning proposal
  -> operator/controller decision or policy-approved controller action
  -> normal user/agent todo or gate
  -> quota / lease / boundary checked delivery turn
```

This keeps server-side dreaming and periodic replanning useful without turning
the server into a hidden autonomous agent. The server owns durable scheduling
facts and proposal records; the client and executor still perform the visible
human-in-the-loop transition and bounded delivery work.

## Multica Reference Point

Multica is a useful reference implementation for this product split, but Goal
Harness should borrow the shape rather than the full product category.

Public Multica docs describe a stack with a Next.js frontend, a Go backend
using Chi / sqlc / WebSocket, PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector, and a local agent
daemon that runs coding CLIs. Its CLI/daemon guide makes the daemon the local
runtime: it detects installed agent CLIs, registers runtimes with the server,
polls for claimed tasks, creates isolated workspaces, starts the agent CLI,
streams results back, and sends heartbeats.

The Goal Harness takeaway:

- **Database first**: durable coordination facts should live in a real state
  store or a file-backed equivalent before they are projected into UI, prompts,
  or handoff packets.
- **Backend as control API**: server code should enforce schemas,
  idempotency, leases, boundaries, quota, and projection contracts.
- **Daemon / executor outside the state store**: agent execution belongs in a
  local daemon, Codex/App loop, terminal agent, or benchmark runner. The server
  schedules and observes; it does not become the model runtime.
- **Event stream plus projections**: issue/task status, comments, blockers,
  heartbeats, claims, and results should be appendable facts that can produce
  first-screen cards, review packets, and automation prompts.
- **Vector memory is optional**: pgvector is useful when a product wants skill
  or memory retrieval. Goal Harness should not require vector storage for v0
  control-plane correctness; relational/event facts come first.

So "server" in Goal Harness should usually mean:

```text
durable state store
  + event ledger
  + typed write API
  + projection API
  + scheduler / quota decisions
```

not:

```text
agent runtime
  + hidden planner
  + autonomous executor
```

### Client

The client is the user's agent-facing proxy. It turns human intent into
governed control-plane transitions and turns raw agent activity back into an
operator-readable surface.

The client can be a CLI, dashboard, Lark document workflow, browser UI, or host
adapter. The important product responsibility is the same:

- explain what the goal is trying to accomplish now;
- show what happened, what is blocked, and what will happen next;
- collect user judgment, taste, approval, rejection, deferral, or reward;
- translate that input into gates, preferences, todo changes, or handoffs;
- route executor loops toward the current state without embedding stale policy;
- make side-agent ownership and review expectations visible.

This is why the client is more than intent classification. It is a product
surface for long-running work: it carries context, permission, feedback,
visibility, and trust.

### Executor Loop

The executor loop is Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, a terminal agent, a benchmark
runner, or another bounded worker. It does the work, but it should not be the
long-term source of truth.

An executor loop should:

- read the current goal state and quota decision before work;
- respect user gates, public/private boundaries, and claimed todo ownership;
- keep one turn bounded to the selected todo or safe side path;
- write back evidence, validation, blockers, and next-step proposals;
- stop before credentials, destructive git, private material, production
  actions, or unapproved publication boundaries.

The executor can be powerful without being the product authority. Goal Harness
keeps the authority in the shared state that the user, primary agent, and side
agents can all inspect.

## Interaction Loop

The product loop is:

```text
user
  -> client
  -> Goal Harness server/state
  -> executor loop
  -> Goal Harness server/state
  -> client
  -> user
```

The client should not bypass the server by turning every user sentence directly
into an agent instruction. The executor should not bypass the client by hiding
important decisions in chat or local memory. Goal Harness exists so user
judgment, agent work, evidence, and future planning remain visible in the same
control plane.

## Capability Boundaries

Goal Harness should not become:

- an agent runtime that owns model execution, tools, billing, or permissions;
- a generic workflow engine where every step is a hidden automation edge;
- a raw transcript store for private chat, logs, benchmark traces, or local
  evidence;
- a crawler, publisher, or production-action authority;
- a replacement for project-specific adapters, evaluators, or domain tools.

It should provide the governed projection around those systems: goal state,
gates, todos, claims or leases, quota, evidence summaries, run history,
feedback, planning proposals, and handoff packets.

## First Contract Slices

The first product slices should remain small and compatible with CLI-only mode.

1. **`goal_channel_projection_v0`**: a read-only first-screen projection for
   goal, gate, todos, current blocker, latest evidence, quota, and next action.
2. **`agent_profile_v0`**: registered agent identity with role, primary/side
   relationship, default scope, worktree policy, and review handoff policy.
3. **`task_lease_v0`**: per-`(goal_id, todo_id)` ownership with TTL,
   idempotency key, write scope, renewal, transfer, and conflict behavior.
4. **`planning_queue_v0`**: advisory planning, dreaming, and replanning
   proposals that remain non-executable until promoted by controller or user
   decision plus normal quota and boundary checks. The minimal record should
   include proposal id, source run window, due/retry policy, candidate todo
   refs, confidence, promotion target, and idempotency key.
5. **`feedback_signal_v0`**: user feedback captured as one of four control
   effects: gate decision, preference hint, todo mutation, or product
   improvement note. Raw private chat should not become public evidence.
6. **`handoff_packet_v0`**: compact executor input that carries the selected
   todo, stop condition, validation expectation, boundary notes, and writeback
   target without copying the whole project history.

Each slice should have a CLI fallback, a compact status projection, and one
public/private boundary check before it becomes part of a richer UI.

## Roadmap Implication

This product shape changes the center of gravity from "a CLI around a Markdown
goal file" to "a dynamic goal control plane with CLI as the first client."

That does not make the CLI obsolete. The CLI is the compatibility baseline and
the safety fallback. It also keeps contracts honest: if a future server or
dashboard cannot fall back to equivalent CLI reads and writes, it is probably
creating a second source of truth.

The near-term roadmap should therefore prefer:

- contract-first status and write APIs over UI-only state;
- local concurrency correctness before broad server scheduling;
- side-agent scope and worktree policy before autonomous multi-agent merging;
- planning proposals before background execution;
- user feedback modeling before personalization claims.

The product promise stays the same across these layers: make the human decision
explicit, keep safe side work moving when it is independent, and make every
agent loop leave enough evidence for the next loop to recover the plot.
