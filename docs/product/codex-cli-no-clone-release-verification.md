# Codex CLI No-Clone Release Verification

Status: release verification note.

The Codex CLI first-run route can be advertised as the preferred interactive
path only when the shipped command surface matches the docs. The user should
not have to clone Goal Harness before trying it from a project repo.

## Verification Shape

The release verifier exercises the path as a fresh user would see it:

1. create a temporary HOME and a temporary project repo;
2. run `scripts/install-from-github.sh` with the same archive-installer
   mechanism used by the public no-clone command;
3. confirm the installed `goal-harness` wrapper can run `doctor`;
4. confirm the installed help surface exposes the first-run commands:
   `codex-cli-bootstrap-message`, `codex-cli-tui-bootstrap-smoke-bundle`, and
   `codex-cli-visible-attach-acceptance`;
5. generate the one-message TUI bootstrap text from the fresh project;
6. generate the transcript-free bootstrap bundle from the fresh project;
7. replay the public proof-capture fixture from the installed release snapshot.

The verifier does not launch Codex, read transcripts, read session files, read
credentials, mutate a Codex session, or spend Goal Harness quota.

Run it with:

```bash
python3 examples/codex-cli-no-clone-release-verification-smoke.py
```

## Current Result

Current release route: **ready as the default candidate, with one boundary**.

Ready:

- the archive installer creates a stable release snapshot without requiring a
  local Goal Harness checkout;
- the installed wrapper exposes the first-run TUI bootstrap, smoke bundle, and
  visible-attach acceptance commands;
- the generated bootstrap text tells the agent to install, connect, run quota,
  preserve the visible TUI, write back evidence, and avoid raw transcripts;
- the smoke bundle confirms no Codex launch and no Goal Harness quota spend;
- proof-capture fixtures are packaged into the release snapshot and can be
  replayed by the installed wrapper.

Boundary:

- public install still depends on network access to GitHub archive endpoints
  unless the caller overrides `GOAL_HARNESS_ARCHIVE_URL` with a trusted archive;
- same-TUI automation is not the default path until visible proof plus runtime
  idle evidence pass.

That means the product copy can prefer no-clone install for Codex CLI users,
while contributor clone-plus-canary remains the development path.

## Release Checklist

Before promoting a new release snapshot, run:

```bash
python3 examples/codex-cli-no-clone-release-verification-smoke.py
python3 examples/codex-cli-first-run-rehearsal-smoke.py
python3 examples/codex-cli-tui-bootstrap-smoke-bundle-smoke.py
python3 examples/codex-cli-proof-capture-demo-fixtures-smoke.py
```

If the first command fails, do not advertise no-clone as the default until the
failure is reduced to a compact blocker: missing installer dependency, archive
layout mismatch, missing installed command, broken bootstrap generation, or
missing public proof fixture.

## Boundary

Keep this verification public-safe:

- no raw Codex transcript or session material;
- no credentials, auth material, or private local paths;
- no benchmark logs, task text, trajectories, or production evidence;
- no Codex execution as part of the verifier.
