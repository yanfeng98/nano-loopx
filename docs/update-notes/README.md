# LoopX Update Notes

LoopX publishes a public-safe update note every two weeks. The notes summarize
what changed in the public repository, what shipped as product surface, and
which control-plane or documentation contracts became more stable.

The update-note source of truth is public repository history: merged PRs,
commit subjects, shipped docs, public smokes, and public CLI behavior. Private
chat, internal documents, raw benchmark traces, local paths, credentials, and
operator-only state are intentionally excluded.

## Publication Rules

- Keep each note compact and public-safe.
- Prefer stable product themes over raw commit lists.
- Link public docs or PRs when the reference is useful, but do not require a
  reader to inspect private state.
- Treat the note as a summary surface. The source of truth remains public git
  history, LoopX CLI behavior, and shipped docs.
- Publish on a two-week cadence anchored at the initial public scaffold on
  2026-05-31.
- Next expected window: 2026-07-12 to 2026-07-25.

## Automation

See [Biweekly update-note automation](automation.md) for the recommended
publication path. The short version: `.github/workflows/update-notes.yml` runs
a separate read-only release-note job that uploads a reviewable draft artifact;
a human opens a PR when the draft is ready. This is not custom logic inside the
active LoopX heartbeat.
