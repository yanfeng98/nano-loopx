# Complex Project Read-Only Adapter

Some projects are too large for a single goal tick to understand safely. They
may have many docs, TODO systems, reports, tests, external sync surfaces, and
active branches. For these projects, the first Goal Harness adapter should not
edit files. It should build a read-only map.

The adapter's job is to answer:

- What is the current goal?
- Which files or systems are authoritative?
- Which work clusters are active?
- Which validation surfaces prove progress?
- Which sub-agent scopes are safe to run in parallel?
- What should be handed to the project main controller?

## Read-Only Map Shape

A read-only adapter map should contain:

```json
{
  "goal_id": "complex-project-main-control",
  "classification": "read_only_map_ready",
  "recommended_action": "ask the project controller to opt in before mutations",
  "authority_sources": [],
  "work_clusters": [],
  "validation_surfaces": [],
  "subagent_scopes": [],
  "boundary_findings": [],
  "handoff_packet": {}
}
```

The map is evidence, not a command. The project controller still decides what
to do next.

## Authority Sources

List the files or systems that define project truth. Examples:

- project TODO or issue board,
- document registry,
- design docs,
- current git status,
- recent run reports,
- test or CI entrypoints,
- managed external-doc manifest.

Each source should include:

- `path` or stable identifier,
- `source_type`,
- `read_status`,
- `why_it_matters`,
- `privacy_level`: `public`, `project-local`, or `private`.

## Work Clusters

Group active work by the type of evidence needed to finish it:

- docs or design cleanup,
- benchmark or eval work,
- runtime or adapter work,
- external-doc sync,
- PR or CI work,
- governance or public/private boundary work.

Each cluster should include:

- current status,
- likely owner,
- blocking condition,
- safe next probe,
- whether sub-agents can inspect it independently.

## Validation Surfaces

Complex projects rarely have one pass/fail metric. A useful adapter names the
surfaces explicitly:

| Work type | Validation surface |
| --- | --- |
| Docs | markdown structure, links, registry entry, review note |
| External sync | manifest, remote fetch, comment/highlight preservation |
| Benchmark/eval | run artifact, metric file, trace, hidden/eval split |
| Code | unit tests, type checks, integration smoke test |
| PR/CI | branch status, CI checks, review comments |
| Public release | sensitive scan, README quickstart, examples |

## Sub-Agent Scopes

The read-only adapter should propose child scopes, not launch them by itself:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "docs-map",
    "role": "explorer",
    "work_scope": ["docs/**", "README.md"],
    "write_allowed": false,
    "expected_output": "task clusters and authoritative docs"
  },
  {
    "id": "validation-map",
    "role": "validator",
    "work_scope": ["tests/**", "scripts/**", ".github/**"],
    "write_allowed": false,
    "expected_output": "available validation commands and coverage gaps"
  },
  {
    "id": "boundary-map",
    "role": "explorer",
    "work_scope": ["docs/**", "examples/**", "scripts/**"],
    "write_allowed": false,
    "expected_output": "public/private boundary risks"
  }
]
```

The controller may accept, edit, or reject these scopes before spawning agents.

## Handoff Packet

The final output to the project controller should be short:

- current classification,
- one recommended action,
- active work clusters,
- proposed sub-agent scopes,
- validation surfaces,
- hard guards,
- files inspected,
- residual risk.

Do not include raw private evidence in a handoff packet intended for another
thread or public artifact.

## Upgrade Path

Use staged adapter status:

1. `planned`: goal exists in registry, no run yet.
2. `read-only-map-ready`: adapter can produce a current map.
3. `connected-read-only`: project controller has opted in to read-only runs.
4. `selective-assist`: controller may ask Goal Harness for bounded edits with
   explicit write scopes.

`goal-harness read-only-map --dry-run` is allowed at `planned` as a controller
opt-in preview. It reads only registry metadata, active-state sections, and the
bounded file inventory, returns `opt_in_required=true`, and appends no run.
Running without `--dry-run` still requires `read-only-map-ready`,
`connected-read-only`, or `connected`.

The preview also returns `residual_risks`, using stable labels such as
`planned_adapter_requires_controller_opt_in` and
`project_local_goal_state_not_detected`, so the target controller can review
one shared risk vocabulary.

Skipping directly to editing creates avoidable coordination risk.
