# Benchmark Active Case Status 2026-06-20

This note tracks the current cloud-host benchmark case queue after the
agent-runtime refactor and the switch to Codex app-server Goal as the default
host-agent surface. It is an operational status layer, not the final evidence
ledger.

Public boundary:

- no raw task text, raw trajectories, verifier output, raw logs, credentials,
  uploads, or leaderboard submissions are copied here;
- remote absolute paths are intentionally omitted;
- completed rows should be upserted into `benchmark-run-ledger.json` from
  compact `benchmark_run_v0` artifacts before case-analysis interpretation;
- running rows stay here until they produce a compact result or a precise
  compact blocker.

## Current Protocol

- Host-side Codex Goal baseline should use app-server Goal when available:
  `thread/start`, `thread/goal/set`, `thread/goal/get`, then `turn/start`.
- TUI `/goal` is a fallback/diagnostic surface, not the default automation
  baseline.
- Agent runtime should be a preinstalled stable layer. Case containers should
  run the task, official tests, and benchmark verifier only.
- Remote benchmark checkout patches must follow
  `docs/benchmark-developer-workflow.md#remote-checkout-patch-protocol`.

## Active Cloud Batch

Batch id: `parallel-benchmark-20260620T131254Z`.

| Benchmark | Case | Route / Arm | Compact Status | Current Status | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `terminal-bench@2.0` | `build-cython-ext` | host Codex app-server Goal | compact official metadata score `0.0`; ledger upserted under `gh-terminal-build-cython-ext-host-app-server-goal-r9-20260620`; `thread/goal/get` confirmed `active`; `turn/start` id present; raw transcript not recorded | completed: app-server route reached agent completion and official Terminal-Bench closeout, but official accuracy was `0.0` | Treat as a real native Goal baseline result, not a setup blocker; next Terminal-Bench work should rerun an early historical pass/control case or launch a treatment arm. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `llm-prefix-cache-replay` | BenchFlow ACP blind-loop baseline | compact official score `0.0`; ledger upserted under `gh-skillsbench-llm-prefix-cloud-pair-r1-20260620` | completed | Treat as no-uplift runtime-refactor sanity, not as native Codex Goal baseline evidence. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `llm-prefix-cache-replay` | Goal Harness blind-loop treatment | compact official score `0.0`; ledger upserted under `gh-skillsbench-llm-prefix-cloud-pair-r1-20260620` | completed | Pair with the baseline row as `paired_no_score_uplift`; next SkillsBench work should either implement the app-server Goal surface or pick the next ACP-compatible canary explicitly as non-native-Goal evidence. |
| `swe-marathon` | `find-network-alignments` | host Codex app-server Goal through Harbor bridge | compact official score `0.0`; ledger upserted under `gh-swe-find-network-alignments-host-app-server-goal-r6-20260620`; `thread/goal/get` confirmed `active`; `turn/start` id present; raw transcript not recorded; bridge responses observed | completed: app-server route reached Harbor environment operation, agent execution, verifier, and job closeout; official verifier returned `0.0` | Treat as a real native Goal baseline result with `official_verifier_solution_failure`; next SWE-Marathon work should either run a second small case or compare a treatment under the same no-upload boundary. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `tictoc-unnecessary-abort-detection` | BenchFlow ACP blind-loop baseline | compact official score `0.0`; ledger upserted under `gh-skillsbench-tictoc-cloud-pair-r2-20260620` | completed as r2; r1 duplicate rerun may continue as background validation | Treat as ACP-compatible baseline evidence: runner/verifier completed, but the selected case did not score. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `tictoc-unnecessary-abort-detection` | Goal Harness blind-loop treatment | compact official score `0.0`; ledger upserted under `gh-skillsbench-tictoc-cloud-pair-r2-20260620` | completed as r2; r1 duplicate rerun may continue as background validation | Pair with the ACP baseline as `paired_no_score_uplift`; next SkillsBench work should rotate to another early case or implement a native app-server Goal worker surface. |

## Rerun Queue After App-Server Sync

The queue below is the near-term order for rerunning earlier cases under the
current host-runtime protocol. It should be updated after every compact result
or blocker.

| Priority | Benchmark | Case | Reason To Rerun | Required Before Launch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | `terminal-bench@2.0` | `build-cython-ext` | route canary with historical pass and current native Goal baseline result `0.0` | completed baseline; next slot should be treatment or a different historical pass/control case, not another route-readiness retry. |
| P0 | `swe-marathon` | `find-network-alignments` | first active SWE-Marathon cloud case completed at official score `0.0` | completed baseline; next slot should be a second small case or matching treatment arm. |
| P0 | `skillsbench@1.1` | `llm-prefix-cache-replay` | runtime-refactor pair just completed at `0.0/0.0` | no immediate same-policy rerun; choose app-server surface implementation or a new canary. |
| P1 | `skillsbench@1.1` | `tictoc-unnecessary-abort-detection` | previously setup-blocked; useful verifier/runtime canary | compact closeout produced `0.0/0.0`; do not spend another primary slot here unless using it as a duplicate stability check. |
| P1 | `terminal-bench@2.0` | `make-doom-for-mips` | timeout/continuation attribution candidate | timeout phase attribution and app-server route canary complete. |
| P1 | `terminal-bench@2.0` | `mteb-retrieve` | environment setup blocker candidate | environment setup preflight proves the task reaches agent or writes a compact blocker. |
| P1 | `skillsbench@1.1` | `travel-planning` | recent cloud case completed at `0.0`; good low-risk sanity/control case | decide whether the next run is ACP control or native Goal route experiment. |
| P2 | `terminal-bench@2.0` | `multi-source-data-merger`, `nginx-request-logging`, `large-scale-text-editing` | historical pass/non-regression controls | rerun only after the app-server route needs pass-case controls. |

## Update Rule

1. Poll active cloud runs with `scripts/benchmark_run_status_snapshot.py`.
2. If a compact `benchmark_run_v0` exists, upsert it into
   `benchmark-run-ledger.json` and regenerate the Markdown ledger.
3. If no compact result exists but the run has a bounded blocker, write a
   compact blocker artifact and update this file.
4. Promote a case into `benchmark-case-analysis.json` only after the compact
   result teaches a durable routing, uplift, no-uplift, regression, or
   infrastructure lesson.
