# Monitor Poll Autonomous Replan Record v0

## Trigger

- Goal: `goal-harness-meta`
- Trigger kind: `run_history_no_progress_repeat`
- Evidence: two public `quota_monitor_poll` records
  (`2026-06-13T18:34:25+08:00` and `2026-06-13T18:55:10+08:00`)
  ended with no material transition and no quota spend.
- Latest trigger time: `2026-06-13T18:55:10+08:00`

## Selected Slice

Close this replan loop with this compact record, validate the autonomous replan
contract, write back state, spend exactly once after validation, then return the
controller to its ordinary guard flow.

The selected live lane remains AgentIssue-Bench `lagent_239`, but the meta
heartbeat is only the monitor/control-plane lane. The next real benchmark work
is to observe for a compact public execution result or blocker from the separate
benchmark execution thread. If no such result exists, stay quiet without quota
spend. Do not execute Docker, invoke Codex/model APIs, sync auth material, read
raw task/patch/log/trajectory/screenshot material, upload, submit, touch public
ranking paths, or broaden to another benchmark from this heartbeat.

## Validation

```bash
python3 examples/autonomous-replan-obligation-smoke.py
```

## Stop Condition

Stop if the next slice requires private material, credentials, destructive git,
production actions, or owner-only execution decisions.
