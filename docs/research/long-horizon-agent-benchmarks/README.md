# Long-Horizon Agent Benchmark Research

This topic folder owns Goal Harness research on public long-horizon agent
benchmarks, external leaderboard strategy, operator-simulator study design, and
paper-oriented experiment planning.

Keep this folder focused on research artifacts:

- benchmark and paper dossiers;
- runner setup notes and legality/protocol reviews;
- official leaderboard versus passive-control-plane versus assisted-simulator
  experiment plans;
- result summaries, failure taxonomies, and publication-readiness notes.

Do not implement Goal Harness product capability here. Foundational capability
work still belongs in the existing code, examples, and contract documents:

- CLI, quota, status, history, registry, and dashboard behavior belongs under
  `goal_harness/`, `scripts/`, and the existing contract docs.
- Deterministic smoke or regression coverage belongs under `examples/`.
- General Goal Harness control-plane specs belong under top-level `docs/`.
- This folder may link to those artifacts, but should not become a parallel
  implementation or a second product-spec tree.

## Current Artifacts

- `benchmark-program-current-state-handoff-v0.md`: compact current-state
  runbook for fresh workers, summarizing the active benchmark evidence layer,
  docs-only projection decisions, allowed next transitions, and stop
  conditions without adding hot-path projection keys.
- `roadmap.md`: benchmark selection, passive baseline, operator-simulator, and
  publication-readiness roadmap.
- `paper-runner-dossier.md`: first evidence-backed ranking of benchmark papers,
  runner surfaces, Codex compatibility signals, and the next Terminal-Bench
  probe slice.
- `terminal-bench-probe-v0.md`: first public-safe runner-boundary probe for
  Terminal-Bench and Harbor, including Codex CLI integration surfaces, output
  files for passive Goal Harness ingestion, and the stop condition before paid
  or leaderboard execution.
- `benchmark-run-v0-ingest.md`: first passive `benchmark_run_v0` ingestion
  contract for Harbor job outputs, with deterministic fixture coverage and no
  default Docker, model, cloud, or leaderboard execution.
- `passive-baseline-protocol-v0.md`: paired bare Codex CLI versus passive Goal
  Harness wrapper protocol, connecting local `benchmark_result_v0` comparison
  evidence to compact `benchmark_run_v0` history rows without operator
  simulation.
- `operator-simulator-overlay-v0.md`: assisted operator-simulator overlay
  protocol after the passive baseline, including comparison modes, simulator
  matrix, visibility limits, intervention budget, failure taxonomy, and the
  `operator_simulator_run_v0` row shape.
- `benchmark-experiment-report-template-v0.md`: paper-ready
  `benchmark_experiment_report_v0` template that keeps official scores,
  passive control-plane metrics, assisted operator-simulator ablations,
  overhead, failure taxonomy, reproducibility artifacts, claim boundaries, and
  negative results in separate report sections.
- `benchmark-report-chain-map-v0.md`: compact reviewer-facing chain map that
  ties `benchmark_run_v0`, `benchmark_result_v0`, `benchmark_comparison_v0`,
  `benchmark_comparison_decision_note_v0`,
  `benchmark_experiment_report_v0`,
  `benchmark_experiment_report_readiness_note_v0`, and
  `benchmark_experiment_report_replay_decision_v0` into one fixture/status
  handoff boundary.
- `benchmark-result-control-plane-score-v0.md`: minimal
  `control_plane_score_core_v0` schema for `benchmark_result_v0`, separating
  official task score from restartability, stale-state avoidance, evidence
  discipline, boundary safety, writeback quality, gate compliance, failure
  attribution, and overhead.
- `mini-control-plane-repair-with-interrupt-v0.md`: deterministic recovery
  fixture slice for `mini_control_plane_repair_with_interrupt_v0`, proving
  worker interruption, stale latest-run avoidance, validation failure capture,
  human-gate resume recheck, and side-effect audit before any real benchmark
  runner path.
- `mini-control-plane-interrupt-comparison-summary-v0.md`: compact fixture-only
  comparison between the non-interrupt and interrupt mini control-plane repair
  modes, preserving official-score versus control-plane-score separation and
  claim boundaries before any status/review-packet projection.
- `mini-control-plane-interrupt-projection-decision-v0.md`: fixture-only
  decision to keep `benchmark_interrupt_comparison_summary_v0` research-only
  until a real consumer or passive benchmark run justifies status/review-packet
  projection.
- `terminal-bench-official-pilot-readiness-v0.md`: local-only readiness
  fixture for `terminal_bench_official_pilot_decision_packet_v0`, proving the
  `benchmark_result_v0` comparison shell and control-plane checklist before any
  real Terminal-Bench, Docker, Codex/model API, cloud, paid compute, or
  leaderboard path.
- `terminal-bench-no-submit-boundary-probe-v0.md`: local-only
  `runner_boundary_probe_v0` contract that records runner identity, planned
  command boundaries, submit eligibility, future event shape, and hard stop
  conditions without running Terminal-Bench, Harbor, Docker, Codex/model APIs,
  cloud sandboxes, paid compute, or leaderboard upload paths.
- `terminal-bench-no-submit-approval-packet-v0.md`: smallest
  `terminal_bench_no_submit_approval_packet_v0` operator packet for a future
  no-submit setup check, listing exact candidate commands, forbidden surfaces,
  public artifact shapes, side-effect budgets, stop conditions, and compact
  `benchmark_run_v0` / `benchmark_result_v0` ingestion rules without executing
  the runner path.
- `terminal-bench-no-submit-approval-packet-projection-decision-v0.md`:
  fixture-only decision to keep the no-submit approval packet research/docs-only
  until an agent consumer, approved no-submit setup check, passive wrapper, or
  repeated re-derivation justifies a compact hot-path projection.
- `terminal-bench-treatment-arm-taxonomy-v0.md`: no-run taxonomy correction
  separating `hardened_codex_baseline`, Codex runtime `codex_goal_mode`,
  true `codex_goal_harness`, and `passive_goal_harness_observer`. It records
  that `create_goal` / `update_goal` are Codex runtime goal-tool calls, not
  Goal Harness CLI calls, and requires future results to count
  `codex_runtime_goal_tool_calls`, `goal_harness_cli_calls`,
  `goal_harness_state_reads`, and `goal_harness_state_writes` separately.
- `terminal-bench-goal-harness-access-packet-v0.md`: no-run access-packet and
  interaction-counter fixture for the true `codex_goal_harness` arm. It defines
  the public worker packet, keeps Codex runtime goal tools separate from Goal
  Harness CLI/state calls, and adds compact `benchmark_run_v0` counter
  projection before any fake-worker or real benchmark repeat.
- `terminal-bench-goal-harness-cli-bridge-contract-v0.md`: host-agent bridge
  contract for the future true `codex_goal_harness` arm. It maps
  `status`, `quota_should_run`, `todo_list`, `history`, `check`, and
  `append_benchmark_run` to executable Goal Harness CLI templates, with a smoke
  that runs those templates against a temporary registry. The same contract is
  now wired into `goal-harness benchmark run terminal-bench --mode
  codex-goal-harness --cli-bridge-contract`, producing compact runner-side
  bridge availability and `goal_harness_cli_calls.total=6` counters while
  keeping Terminal-Bench/Codex/model execution disabled.
- `terminal-bench-codex-goal-harness-active-cli-bridge-v0.md`: core
  `codex_goal_harness` treatment surface. It adds
  `goal_harness_cli_bridge_enabled=true` to `GoalHarnessManagedCodex`, injects
  worker-side `goal-harness ... status/quota/todo/history/check/append` command
  templates into the Codex instruction, and keeps worker in-case
  `goal_harness_cli_calls.total=6` separate from runner-side bridge probes. It
  also exposes the no-run `--preflight-guard --active-cli-bridge` route for the
  next private repeat and records a claim gate requiring nonzero worker-side
  Goal Harness CLI calls before any in-case use claim.
- `terminal-bench-codex-goal-harness-fake-worker-v0.md`: first executable
  fixture mode for the true `codex_goal_harness` arm:
  `goal-harness benchmark run terminal-bench --mode codex-goal-harness
  --fake-worker`. It appends a no-run/no-submit `benchmark_run_v0` event with
  nonzero Goal Harness CLI/state interaction counters, while keeping Codex
  runtime goal-tool calls separate and preserving no-uplift/no-leaderboard
  boundaries.
- `terminal-bench-codex-goal-harness-custom-agent-v0.md`: custom-agent prompt
  surface for the true `codex_goal_harness` arm. It wires the Goal Harness
  access packet into `GoalHarnessManagedCodex` through
  `goal_harness_mode=codex_goal_harness`, adds compact trace-audited counter
  extraction, and verifies the Harbor command preview before any real repeat.
- `terminal-bench-codex-goal-harness-preflight-guard-v0.md`: no-upload
  preflight guard for `goal-harness benchmark run terminal-bench --mode
  codex-goal-harness --preflight-guard`. It checks runner/Codex/local execution
  surfaces, access-packet prompt injection, trace-counter contract availability,
  and compact preflight/status projection without running Harbor tasks, Codex
  workers, model APIs, uploads, or leaderboard paths.
- `terminal-bench-runner-mode-contract-v0.md`: no-run mode contract for the
  future `goal-harness benchmark run terminal-bench ...` wrapper, separating
  parent runner control-plane behavior from per-case worker modes
  `hardened-codex` and `codex-goal-harness`. The contract treats hardened
  Codex as the true paired baseline for this experiment and
  `codex-goal-harness` as the core `model + harness` pair.
- `terminal-bench-official-hard-case-selection-v0.md`: no-run selection
  contract that moves the next evidence target from `terminal-bench-sample@2.0`
  to official `terminal-bench@2.0`, selects a three-case hard/long-horizon
  primary batch (`fix-code-vulnerability`, `modernize-scientific-stack`, and
  `llm-inference-batching-scheduler`), defines a backup queue, and preserves
  paired-run invariants for `hardened-codex` versus `codex-goal-harness`,
  claim boundaries, metrics, and stop conditions before any full 89-task run or
  leaderboard path.
- `terminal-bench-cli-dry-run-fake-worker-v0.md`: public CLI skeleton for
  `goal-harness benchmark run terminal-bench`. The command defaults to dry-run,
  exposes `hardened-codex`, `codex-goal-harness`, passive observation, and
  `goal-harness-managed-codex`, and can append only compact fixture
  `benchmark_run_v0` rows when `--execute` is passed. The current fake-worker
  path is allowed only for managed mode and records
  `goal_harness_managed_codex_fake_worker_wrapper` without invoking real
  Harbor, Terminal-Bench, Docker, Codex, model APIs, uploads, or leaderboard
  paths.
- `terminal-bench-managed-real-run-preflight-guard-v0.md`: no-run guard packet
  for the first managed Goal Harness Terminal-Bench case. It rechecks runner,
  local Docker/Colima, Codex CLI, auth-surface-name, no-upload, and artifact
  redaction boundaries, appends only a compact readiness `benchmark_run_v0`
  when executed, and stops before Harbor, Terminal-Bench, Codex worker,
  benchmark task container, model API, uploads, or leaderboard paths.
- `terminal-bench-managed-codex-custom-agent-v0.md`: first concrete Harbor
  custom-agent bridge for the core managed treatment, using
  `--agent-import-path goal_harness.terminal_bench_agent:GoalHarnessManagedCodex`
  to subclass Harbor's built-in Codex adapter, inject a minimal Goal Harness
  policy envelope, defer public-safe managed metadata until Codex post-run
  session ingestion, and preserve no-upload/private pilot boundaries while
  stopping before leaderboard, uplift, or paper-ready claims.
- `benchmark-history-reconstructability-v0.md`: restartability fixture proving
  compact benchmark run history can reconstruct official-score,
  control-plane-score, claim-boundary, readiness, authorization,
  replay-decision, next-run-mode, and stop-condition state without raw logs,
  private traces, local artifact paths, chat history, or extra hot-path keys.
- `benchmark-restart-actionability-v0.md`: restarted-worker actionability
  fixture proving a compact reconstructed decision can produce exactly one
  bounded local fixture command or a public-safe blocker while preserving
  fixture-only authorization, no-leaderboard claims, and real-run stop
  conditions.
- `benchmark-restart-actionability-projection-decision-v0.md`: fixture-only
  decision to keep `benchmark_restart_actionability_v0` research/docs-only
  until a real restarted-worker consumer, approved no-submit setup evidence, or
  repeated re-derivation justifies a compact hot-path projection.

## Relationship To Goal Harness Work

The research track should discover what to measure and which public benchmark
protocols are credible. Once the work requires a Goal Harness feature, that
feature should be split into a normal product todo and implemented in the
existing public capability surface, with this folder retaining only the research
motivation, protocol, and result evidence.
