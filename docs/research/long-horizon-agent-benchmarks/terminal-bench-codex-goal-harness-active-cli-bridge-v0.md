# Terminal-Bench Codex Goal Harness Active CLI Bridge V0

Checked at: 2026-06-08T23:18:00+08:00.

This note records the core `codex_goal_harness` treatment surface: Codex CLI
must receive an in-case Goal Harness bridge and actively call Goal Harness while
solving the task. The earlier runner-side bridge fixture is useful only as a
measurement probe. It is not the treatment evidence.

This slice is still no-run/no-submit. It does not run Harbor, Terminal-Bench,
Docker, real Codex workers, model APIs, uploads, shares, paid/cloud execution,
or leaderboard paths.

## Worker Bridge Packet

`GoalHarnessManagedCodex` now accepts:

```text
goal_harness_mode=codex_goal_harness
goal_harness_cli_bridge_enabled=true
```

When enabled, the first worker instruction contains:

```text

```

The placeholder command packet is public-safe. A private no-upload repeat may
substitute actual mounted paths in the worker environment, but those raw values
must stay out of public artifacts. Workers must not execute a command while
angle-bracket placeholders remain unresolved; they should substitute concrete
values first and execute with shell quoting or an argv list so placeholders are
never interpreted as shell redirection. The final `append_benchmark_run` belongs
after final validation/cleanup or after a terminal blocker decision.

## Trace Ingestion

The active bridge requires a private compact JSONL trace file, passed as
`goal_harness_counter_trace_json`. The Codex worker should append one compact
row for each Goal Harness CLI call and state read/write. After the run,
`GoalHarnessManagedCodex.populate_context_post_run()` reads that file and
projects only public-safe counters:

```text
goal_harness_counter_trace_row_required_fields=event,command,ok,goal_id,mode,classification
goal_harness_counter_trace_file_loaded=true
goal_harness_counter_trace_row_count=<n>
goal_harness_interaction_counters.goal_harness_cli_calls.total=<n>
```

Each CLI-call row should include the active `goal_id`, worker `mode`, and
benchmark `classification` so a compact trace proves both the call and the
Goal Harness context that was injected. The raw trace path and raw rows stay
private and are not copied into public Goal Harness docs or status.

If the Codex worker exits through an exception path such as a non-zero agent
return, `GoalHarnessManagedCodex.run()` still attempts a `run_finally` compact
worker benchmark_run checkpoint before the exception propagates. When no trace
rows exist, that checkpoint records `active_cli_bridge_no_trace` style evidence
and an interrupted worker-bridge blocker; it does not claim worker bridge
success, official reward, or leaderboard evidence.

## Worker Writeback Shape

The active worker bridge now carries a minimal `benchmark_run_v0` writeback
contract in the first instruction. This is meant to reduce schema retries at the
end of a private repeat: the worker writes compact counts, validation booleans,
and one compact trial summary, then calls `append_benchmark_run`. If that append
is schema-rejected, the worker rewrites the payload to the minimal shape and
retries once. It must not use raw logs, raw paths, raw traces, raw task prompts,
raw session bodies, credential values, or auth values to satisfy the retry.

## Episode Policy

Long-horizon private repeats should stay close to the Codex automation shape:
one Codex worker remains the task-solving actor, while Goal Harness provides
lightweight checkpoint assistance. The active bridge policy is:

```text
single_codex_agent_goal_harness_assisted_checkpoints
worker_topology=single_codex_agent
checkpoint_interval_seconds=600
checkpoint_surface=worker_goal_harness_cli_bridge_compact_jsonl
runner_side_guaranteed_writeback=true
does_not_spawn_additional_agents=true
does_not_split_task_prompt=true
does_not_change_task_solution_actor=true
```

The runner may use these compact checkpoints to observe progress or resume a
timed-out private run, but it must not reinterpret the benchmark as multiple
workers solving separate slices. Final outcome archival still belongs to the
runner-side guaranteed `benchmark_run_v0` writeback.

## Measurement Boundary

Core evidence is worker-side:

```text
worker_goal_harness_cli_calls.total>=1
planned_worker_goal_harness_cli_call_total=2
runner_goal_harness_cli_calls.total=0
goal_harness_default_required_calls=check,append_benchmark_run
goal_harness_optional_context_calls=status,quota_should_run,todo_list,history
goal_harness_state_reads>=1
goal_harness_state_writes=0 when append is dry-run; 1 only for execute
case_result_writeback=worker_bridge_append_benchmark_run_dry_run or worker_bridge_append_benchmark_run_execute
counter_trust_level=compact_trace_audited
```

Runner-side bridge calls are allowed only as setup or measurement probes. They
must not be counted as Goal Harness in-case use.

## Harbor Command Shape

The public command template consumes the generic Goal Harness worker bridge
install contract in `docs/worker-bridge-install-contract.md`. It must make the
bridge package and runtime root visible inside the task container. The current
Harbor adapter uses `--mounts` with placeholder same-path bind mounts, then
passes an in-container command prefix to the Codex worker:

```text
--mounts [{"read_only": true, "source": "<goal-harness-project-root>", "target": "<goal-harness-project-root>", "type": "bind"}, {"read_only": true, "source": "<goal-harness-runtime-root>", "target": "<goal-harness-runtime-root>", "type": "bind"}]
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_mode=codex_goal_harness
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_cli_bridge_enabled=true
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_command_prefix=PYTHONPATH=<goal-harness-project-root> python3 -m goal_harness.cli
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_registry_arg=<goal-harness-runtime-root>/registry.global.json
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_runtime_root_arg=<goal-harness-runtime-root>
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_scan_path=<goal-harness-project-root>/goal_harness/benchmark.py
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_benchmark_run_json=/logs/agent/goal-harness-worker-benchmark-run.json
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_counter_trace_json=/logs/agent/goal-harness-counter-trace.jsonl
--agent-kwarg goal_harness_classification=<classification>
```

This is the route to test before another private no-upload
`terminal-bench-sample@2.0` repeat.

For private local repeats, the runner must use the Goal Harness private runner
environment, which prepends the probe PATH (`~/.local/bin`, Homebrew, and
system bins), and may also use the command builder's private `resolve_cli_paths`
mode. This keeps `uvx`, Docker/Colima, and Codex visible to the same Harbor
process. The public command template intentionally remains `uvx` so local
absolute paths do not enter public docs or status artifacts.

Benchmark events should record only the compact
`private_runner_launch_summary`, never the raw private env. The summary says
whether the launch used the private runner env, whether the private argv was
resolved, how many probe PATH classes were covered, the first preflight blocker,
and the no-upload boundary booleans. It must keep `raw_env_recorded=false`,
`raw_paths_recorded=false`, and `auth_values_recorded=false`.

When the sample set is a local copied dataset directory, Harbor must receive it
through `--path`, not `--dataset`; the latter is reserved for registry package
references such as `org/name@version`. The command builder chooses `--path` for
local-looking dataset strings and keeps `--dataset` for public registry names.

## Private Repeat Preflight

The benchmark wrapper now has a no-run preflight for the next private repeat:

```bash
goal-harness benchmark run terminal-bench \
  --mode codex-goal-harness \
  --preflight-guard \
  --active-cli-bridge
```

Equivalent compact form: `goal-harness benchmark run terminal-bench --mode codex-goal-harness --preflight-guard --active-cli-bridge`.

This command still does not run Harbor, Terminal-Bench, Docker task containers,
Codex workers, model APIs, uploads, or leaderboard paths. It records the planned
worker bridge route as:

```text
goal_harness_cli_bridge_surface=codex_worker_goal_harness_cli_bridge_v0
planned_worker_goal_harness_cli_call_total=2
worker_goal_harness_cli_call_total=0
runner_goal_harness_cli_call_total=0
```

The zero observed worker count is intentional for the preflight. The follow-up
private no-upload sample may only claim in-case Goal Harness use after the real
worker trace reports `worker_goal_harness_cli_call_total >= 1`.

## Claim Boundary

The compact claim gate is:

```text
terminal_bench_goal_harness_claim_gate_v0
requires_worker_goal_harness_cli_calls=true
required_worker_goal_harness_cli_call_total_min=1
reject_runner_bridge_calls_as_in_case_evidence=true
reject_codex_runtime_goal_tool_calls_as_goal_harness_evidence=true
uplift_claim_allowed=false
leaderboard_claim_allowed=false
```

This slice may claim:

```text
Codex worker instructions can now carry an active Goal Harness CLI bridge packet
with concrete command templates and compact counter extraction for worker-side
Goal Harness calls.
```

It must not claim:

- a real benchmark task ran;
- Codex actually called Goal Harness in a real case;
- official task success;
- cost or token improvement;
- leaderboard readiness;
- Goal Harness uplift.

## Smoke

```bash
python3 examples/terminal-bench-codex-goal-harness-active-cli-bridge-smoke.py
```

The smoke uses fake Harbor modules, validates worker prompt command templates,
verifies bridge metadata, checks compact worker-side counters, confirms the
private-repeat preflight claim gate, and confirms the Harbor command preview
can carry the active bridge kwargs without exposing raw private paths.
