# Benchmark Goal Rollout Debug 2026-06-20

This note is a public-safe rollout/debug layer for the benchmark cases that
closed after the cloud-host app-server Goal pivot. It sits between two existing
layers:

- `benchmark-run-ledger.json` records compact final outcomes;
- private cloud-host artifacts and trajectories retain raw task/log/verifier
  evidence.

The missing layer was the one operators and future agents need for debugging:
what path the case took, which Goal Harness todo/status transition drove it,
where official scoring was reached, and which next question should be answered
before spending another case rotation.

Public boundary:

- no raw task text, raw trajectories, verifier output, raw logs, credentials,
  uploads, leaderboard submissions, or remote absolute paths are copied here;
- artifact references are compact logical refs only;
- this file can name case ids, compact run ids, failure classes, status
  classifications, and public-safe phase labels.

## Control-Plane Flow

| Time | GH classification / todo | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2026-06-20T23:25:02+08:00` | `benchmark_app_server_goal_runtime_lane_progress_20260620` | Three benchmark lanes were active; next action was polling Terminal-Bench, SWE-Marathon, and SkillsBench until each yielded compact result or precise blocker. |
| `2026-06-20T23:57:24+08:00` | `benchmark_cloud_goal_closeouts_pr319_merged_20260620` | PR #319 landed the app-server Goal helpers, reducers, SOP updates, and compact case closeouts. |
| `2026-06-20T23:57:59+08:00` | `benchmark_next_action_successor_sync_20260620` / `todo_9b33c85f5b7c` | Control plane moved to next case rotation. |
| `2026-06-21T00:03:04+08:00` | `todo_c5ca9f496ed6` | Owner redirected the next step from rotation to rollout/traj analysis; this todo was created and claimed by `codex-main-control`. |

The important correction is that rotation should not be treated as the next
automatic step until this rollout has been inspected. The current state tells
us "what scored"; it does not yet tell us enough about "why this was the right
next case" or "which phase failed".

## Case Rollouts

| Benchmark | Case | Route | Official Result | Rollout Read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `terminal-bench@2.0` | `build-cython-ext` | host Codex app-server Goal | `0.0`, `official_verifier_solution_failure` | Native Goal route reached official Terminal-Bench closeout. Historical compact control `53729101fea3` passed this case with score `1.0`, so the current zero is not enough to call the case impossible. The missing evidence is public-safe solution-phase attribution. |
| `terminal-bench@2.0` | `multi-source-data-merger` | host Codex app-server Goal observation | `0.0`, `official_verifier_solution_failure` | Current app-server Goal route reached official closeout and wrote compact result. Treat this as a current-route baseline observation for a historical pass/control case, not a setup blocker or paired treatment claim. The next useful signal is phase attribution or a matched treatment/alternate pass-control comparison. |
| `terminal-bench@2.0` | `nginx-request-logging` | host Codex app-server Goal observation | `1.0`, official pass | Current app-server Goal route reached official closeout and passed without recording raw transcript. This is the route sanity control for the batch: app-server Goal can complete at least one Terminal-Bench pass/control case, so the `multi-source-data-merger` zero should be treated as case- or phase-specific until compared. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `react-performance-debugging` | native app-server Goal baseline | `0.0`, `skillsbench_runner_error` | Native worker connection was observed, but the public trace shows no worker trace directory, no turn-start, and no turn-complete evidence. This is route/runner evidence, not solver-quality baseline evidence; the next engineering question is why the host worker connects but does not materialize public worker turn trace. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `llm-prefix-cache-replay` | BenchFlow ACP blind-loop baseline/treatment | `0.0/0.0`, `paired_no_score_uplift` | Runner and verifier reached official score after runtime-layer refactor, but this is not native app-server Goal evidence. Treat it as setup/verifier progress and weak-policy no-uplift evidence. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `tictoc-unnecessary-abort-detection` | BenchFlow ACP blind-loop baseline/treatment | `0.0/0.0`, `paired_no_score_uplift` | Setup/prewarm no longer blocks the case. It is currently a stability canary, not a proof that Goal Harness improves SkillsBench task outcome. |
| `swe-marathon` | `find-network-alignments` | Harbor host Codex app-server Goal | `0.0`, `official_verifier_solution_failure` | First native Goal SWE-Marathon cloud closeout. Harbor reached environment operation, agent execution, verifier, and job closeout; the next missing signal is whether the zero came from timeout/incomplete edit or wrong solution. |
| `swe-marathon` | `rust-c-compiler` | Harbor host Codex app-server Goal, prewarmed/larger-budget r2 | `0.0`, `official_verifier_solution_failure` | Second native Goal SWE-Marathon closeout. The previous setup blocker is superseded: setup, agent execution, official verifier, and job closeout completed. The remaining gap is solution-phase attribution, not Docker capacity. |

## Cross-Case Findings

1. Terminal-Bench and SWE-Marathon are now real app-server Goal baseline
   closeouts. Terminal-Bench has a current-route pass control
   (`nginx-request-logging`) and a current-route zero
   (`multi-source-data-merger`), while SWE-Marathon has two zero-score native
   Goal closeouts; `rust-c-compiler` r2 proves the earlier setup blocker is no
   longer the current bottleneck.
2. SkillsBench has moved from "native worker missing" to "native worker
   connects but does not materialize public worker turn trace". Its ACP rows
   still prove runner/verifier readiness, while the native row remains
   route/runner evidence rather than solver-quality evidence.
3. `official_verifier_solution_failure` is too broad for ongoing debugging.
   It should eventually split into public-safe sublabels such as
   `official_verifier_completed_zero_score`,
   `agent_goal_timeout_then_official_zero`, and
   `solution_phase_incomplete`.
4. A rollout file is the right public artifact for this gap: it can show
   control-plane phase, case route, compact result, and next debug question
   while keeping raw trajectory and verifier evidence private.

## Immediate Debug Questions

- Terminal-Bench: can the reducer expose public-safe app-server/agent phase
  counters, especially timeout versus complete-but-wrong, without copying raw
  trial fields?
- SkillsBench: why does the native app-server Goal worker connect but fail to
  materialize a public worker trace directory and turn-start/turn-complete
  counters?
- SWE-Marathon: can Harbor expose compact edit/test/verify phase counters so
  `official_verifier_solution_failure` is not the only post-closeout label?
- Goal Harness: should active-case status and run ledger both link to this
  rollout layer so future agents can debug the path, not only the score?

## Proposed Durable Shape

For each real benchmark case closeout, write one public-safe rollout row with:

- `benchmark_id`, `case_id`, `run_id`, route, arm, compact artifact ref;
- native Goal evidence flag;
- official score/pass/failure class/failure scope;
- phase labels such as runner preflight, app-server Goal start, agent
  execution, official verifier, ledger writeback;
- GH todo/status transitions that selected, monitored, closed, and followed up
  the run;
- next debug questions.

Raw trajectories remain private. Public trajectory summaries should be counters
only, following `goal_harness/benchmark_trajectory.py`.

The follow-up failure-attribution layer narrows these rows into concrete
obligations: Terminal-Bench and SWE-Marathon need public-safe solution-phase
counters, while SkillsBench should repair native worker public trace
materialization before using more native app-server Goal rows as quality
baselines.
