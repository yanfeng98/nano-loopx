# Benchmark Closeout Failure Attribution 2026-06-20

This note turns the latest compact benchmark closeouts into public-safe failure
attribution. The goal is to stop treating a final `0.0` score as the end of
debugging. A compact closeout answers "what did the verifier record"; this
layer answers "what should the next engineering move be."

Public boundary:

- no raw task text, raw trajectories, verifier output, raw logs, credentials,
  uploads, leaderboard submissions, or remote absolute paths are copied here;
- compact refs, run ids, case ids, route names, and public-safe phase labels
  are allowed;
- raw trajectories and verifier tails remain private runtime evidence.

Machine-readable companion:
`benchmark-closeout-failure-attribution-20260620.json`.

## Policy

Every benchmark case closeout should get failure attribution before the next
rotation. The minimum row is:

- compact run id and route;
- whether this is native Codex app-server Goal evidence;
- official score/pass/failure class;
- what has been ruled out;
- what remains unknown;
- the next reducer, runner, or worker obligation.

`official_verifier_solution_failure` means the runner reached the official
verifier and the verifier returned a failing score. It is not precise enough to
choose the next action by itself: it can hide timeout, incomplete edits, wrong
solution, a weak worker policy, or a bad canary.

## Case Attribution

| Benchmark | Case | Route | Compact Result | Refined Attribution | Next Obligation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `terminal-bench@2.0` | `build-cython-ext` | host Codex app-server Goal | `0.0`, `official_verifier_solution_failure`; historical compact control `53729101fea3` scored `1.0` | `official_zero_native_goal_regression_needs_phase_attribution` | Add public-safe Terminal-Bench phase counters and compare against the historical passing control before launching more treatment on this case. |
| `terminal-bench@2.0` | `multi-source-data-merger` | host Codex app-server Goal observation | `0.0`, `official_verifier_solution_failure`; current route reached official scoring and wrote compact result | `official_zero_current_app_server_goal_baseline_needs_phase_or_treatment_comparison` | Do not treat this as a setup blocker. Compare against current-protocol passing rows and launch either a treatment arm or an alternate pass/control case before making route-quality claims. |
| `terminal-bench@2.0` | `nginx-request-logging` | host Codex app-server Goal observation | `1.0`, official pass; raw transcript not recorded | `native_goal_route_sanity_pass_current_protocol_control` | Use as route sanity evidence that app-server Goal can complete a Terminal-Bench pass/control case; do not spend another primary slot rerunning the same observation unless it is needed as a regression guard. |
| `swe-marathon` | `find-network-alignments` | Harbor host Codex app-server Goal | `0.0`, `official_verifier_solution_failure` | `official_zero_native_goal_first_closeout_needs_solution_phase_counters` | Teach the Harbor/SWE-Marathon reducer to preserve public-safe edit/test/verify phase counters before treating this as model-capability evidence. |
| `swe-marathon` | `rust-c-compiler` | Harbor host Codex app-server Goal, prewarmed/larger-budget r2 | `0.0`, `official_verifier_solution_failure`; setup, agent execution, official verifier, and job closeout completed | `official_zero_native_goal_second_closeout_setup_cleared_needs_solution_phase_counters` | Stop treating this case as an environment blocker; add public-safe edit/test/verify counters or run a matched treatment/alternate small SWE case before making model-quality claims. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `react-performance-debugging` | native app-server Goal baseline, high reasoning | `0.0`, `skillsbench_runner_error`; public compact shows worker connection but no worker trace directory or turn-start evidence | `native_goal_worker_connected_trace_dir_missing_not_solver_quality_evidence` | Repair the native worker public trace materialization path before using this or any new SkillsBench native Goal row as solver-quality baseline evidence. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `llm-prefix-cache-replay` | native app-server Goal baseline, marker-completion handoff | `0.0`, `official_score_zero_case_failure`; worker marker observed/deleted and compact official closeout reached | `native_goal_worker_marker_handoff_repaired_official_zero_needs_solution_phase_attribution` | Stop treating this route as a worker handoff blocker. Add public-safe solution-phase counters, run a matched treatment, or rotate a new canary through the repaired marker route. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `llm-prefix-cache-replay` | BenchFlow ACP blind-loop baseline/treatment | `0.0/0.0`, `paired_no_score_uplift` | `paired_zero_acp_blind_loop_non_native_goal_no_uplift` | Stop using more ACP blind-loop repeats as primary Codex Goal evidence; implement a native SkillsBench app-server Goal worker first. |
| `skillsbench@1.1` | `tictoc-unnecessary-abort-detection` | BenchFlow ACP blind-loop baseline/treatment | `0.0/0.0`, `paired_no_score_uplift` | `paired_zero_acp_blind_loop_non_native_goal_no_uplift` | Keep as a stability canary only until the native SkillsBench app-server Goal worker exists. |

## What This Changes

Terminal-Bench and SWE-Marathon have crossed the important infrastructure
line: app-server Goal can start, run, reach verifier, and produce compact
official closeouts. `nginx-request-logging` now provides a current-route pass
control, while `multi-source-data-merger` shows a current-route zero that needs
phase or treatment comparison before route-quality claims. `rust-c-compiler`
r2 also clears the previous SWE-Marathon setup blocker. These current failures
are no longer setup blockers; the next missing piece is solution-phase
attribution.

SkillsBench has now crossed the worker-handoff line for one native
app-server Goal case. The ACP rows still prove only setup/prewarm/round/scoring
under a non-native blind-loop policy, while the marker-completion native
`llm-prefix-cache-replay` rerun proves the host worker can return to BenchFlow
and reach official closeout. Its `0.0` is therefore no longer a runner-handoff
blocker; the next engineering slice is solution-phase attribution or a matched
treatment/native canary through the repaired marker route.

## Durable Rule

Do not rotate merely because a row has a compact result. Rotate only after the
case has a refined attribution and one of these is true:

- the next obligation is a different benchmark lane;
- the failure is already precise enough for a treatment/control comparison;
- the current lane is blocked on a named reducer or worker capability.
