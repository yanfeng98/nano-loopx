# auto_research_role_profile_v0

`auto_research_role_profile_v0` defines how a LoopX auto-research worker knows
who it is before it loads any role-specific playbook. It bridges three existing
surfaces:

- the shared LoopX control plane, which grants identity and authority;
- role-aware skills, which define how to act inside a phase;
- repository or workspace `AGENTS.md`, which defines long-lived local rules.

The contract exists because Arbor and LoopX use skills differently. Arbor can
keep identity mostly inside a Coordinator / Executor topology, then load skills
as phase playbooks. LoopX is decentralized: several workers may run in separate
Codex sessions over one state graph, so identity must be explicit control-plane
state rather than something inferred from a skill name or pane title.

## Ownership Split

| Surface | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LoopX control plane | `agent_id`, `role_id`, claim, capability token, phase, write boundary, gate state, and stop condition. | The detailed reasoning checklist for an implementation phase. |
| Role-aware skill | Commands, checklists, artifact schema reminders, review prompts, and phase-specific failure modes. | Authority to write, promote, merge, publish, or bypass gates. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Repository-local and workspace-local rules such as private boundary, PR hygiene, first-screen review, protected paths, and local launch policy. | Dynamic role assignment or current frontier selection. |
| Host launcher | Visible panes, environment variables, attach/stop controls, and takeover affordances. | Research truth, promotion decisions, or hidden scheduling authority. |

This split keeps skills useful without letting them become a second source of
identity. A worker can load the same `loopx-auto-research` skill in different
roles, but the profile tells it which section applies and which writes are
allowed.

## Profile Shape

The profile is public-safe and small enough to embed in a launcher packet,
frontier item, bootstrap prompt, or future kernel API.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "auto_research_role_profile_v0",
  "goal_id": "loopx-auto-research-knn",
  "agent_id": "codex-auto-research-runner-1",
  "role_id": "evidence_runner",
  "display_name": "Evidence runner",
  "phase": "attempt_running",
  "capability_token": "evidence_runner",
  "todo_id": "todo_knn_attempt_001",
  "hypothesis_id": "hyp_knn_vectorized_distance",
  "allowed_actions": ["claim_attempt", "edit_allowed_scope", "run_dev_eval", "write_evidence"],
  "write_scope": ["solution.py", "experiments/**"],
  "protected_scope": ["task.py", "eval.py", "data/**"],
  "required_skill": "loopx-auto-research",
  "skill_section": "Evidence runner",
  "agents_overlay": ["workspace/AGENTS.md"],
  "stop_conditions": [
    "quota should-run returns false",
    "frontier is empty or claimed by another agent",
    "protected scope would be edited",
    "private material or credentials are required",
    "operator gate is projected"
  ],
  "handoff_outputs": [
    "research_evidence_event_v0",
    "branch_or_artifact_ref",
    "retry_or_retirement_rationale"
  ]
}
```

Required fields:

- `goal_id`, `agent_id`, `role_id`, `phase`, and `todo_id` identify the current
  worker and work item.
- `capability_token` must match a capability in
  `auto_research_role_state_machine_v0`.
- `allowed_actions`, `write_scope`, `protected_scope`, and `stop_conditions`
  bound what the worker may do.
- `required_skill` and `skill_section` route the worker to the correct how-to
  instructions after identity is resolved.

Optional fields such as `hypothesis_id`, `agents_overlay`, and
`handoff_outputs` make the profile more ergonomic but do not grant authority.

## Resolution Order

Every visible auto-research worker should resolve its instructions in this
order:

1. Read the role profile from the launcher packet, frontier item, or bootstrap
   prompt.
2. Run `quota should-run --goal-id ... --agent-id ...` and confirm the selected
   todo still matches the profile.
3. Read the current role/state-machine contract for allowed transitions.
4. Load the required skill and only the section named by `skill_section`.
5. Read applicable `AGENTS.md` overlays for repository and workspace rules.
6. Act within `allowed_actions` and `write_scope`, then write only the listed
   handoff outputs.

If any source conflicts, the worker fails closed in this order:

1. operator gate or private/security boundary;
2. control-plane quota, claim, capability, or write-scope mismatch;
3. repository `AGENTS.md` safety rule;
4. skill checklist disagreement;
5. launcher pane label or cosmetic prompt text.

## Auto-Research Role Profiles

The v0 demo should expose four logical always-on profiles. A host may render
fewer panes only when the merged duties are explicit in the profile and the
records still name the role that produced each transition.

| Role id | Skill section | Primary phase | Writes | Must stop when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `research_curator` | Research curator | `contract_ready`, `promotion_gate` | `research_contract_v0`, owner gate todos, protected-boundary notes. | The next step would select a winner, run an experiment, or publish unsupported evidence. |
| `hypothesis_mapper` | Hypothesis mapper | `hypothesis_proposed`, `retired` | `research_hypothesis_v0`, successor todos, no-follow-up rationale. | Novelty requires the same source that inspired the idea, or negative evidence would be hidden. |
| `evidence_runner` | Evidence runner | `frontier_selected`, `attempt_running` | Branch refs, dev eval evidence, retry packets. | Protected scope changes, promotion decisions, or private/raw artifacts are needed. |
| `evidence_verifier` | Evidence verifier | `evidence_recorded`, `evaluated`, `promotion_gate` | Evaluation summary, promotion/retirement candidates, gate todos. | Evidence is dev-only but would be presented as promoted, or held-out data is missing when required. |

Future roles such as gate steward, synthesis narrator, and frontier janitor are
split candidates, not required v0 panes. They should be introduced only when
evidence from the demo shows that a transition duty needs a separate owner.

## Skill Strategy

Start with one installed `loopx-auto-research` skill that contains role
sections:

- `Research curator`
- `Hypothesis mapper`
- `Evidence runner`
- `Evidence verifier`
- `Visible takeover and stop controls`

This keeps trigger routing simple while the protocol settles. Split into
role-specific skills only after a visible run shows repeated confusion that a
single role-routed skill cannot prevent. The split decision should cite evidence
such as wrong section loading, unauthorized writes, hidden negative evidence, or
missed stop conditions.

The skill body should not invent current work. Its first command should tell
the agent to read the profile and run the quota/frontier command named by the
profile. This mirrors Arbor's useful "load a checklist at the exact phase"
behavior while preserving LoopX's decentralized identity model.

## Demo Launcher Implications

A visible tmux or terminal launcher should print the profile before starting
Codex:

```bash
export LOOPX_GOAL_ID=loopx-auto-research-knn
export LOOPX_AGENT_ID=codex-auto-research-runner-1
export LOOPX_ROLE_ID=evidence_runner
export LOOPX_ROLE_PROFILE_REF=auto_research_role_profile_v0
loopx auto-research frontier --goal-id "$LOOPX_GOAL_ID" --agent-id "$LOOPX_AGENT_ID"
```

The pane title is cosmetic. The profile and quota/frontier projection are the
authority. The launcher must keep attach, interrupt, and stop commands visible
so the user can take over without reading hidden logs.

## Acceptance Checks

An implementation satisfies this contract when:

- launcher and frontier packets expose `auto_research_role_profile_v0` for each
  visible worker;
- each profile names `agent_id`, `role_id`, `phase`, `capability_token`,
  `allowed_actions`, `write_scope`, `protected_scope`, `required_skill`,
  `skill_section`, and `stop_conditions`;
- the default demo uses the four logical v0 role identities, with owner takeover
  as a visible control surface rather than a research role;
- the role-aware skill says identity comes from the profile and quota/frontier,
  not from the skill itself;
- `AGENTS.md` overlays can add stricter local rules but cannot expand a role's
  authority beyond the control-plane profile;
- validation proves no leader/coordinator pane is required for the demo to be
  understandable or interruptible.
