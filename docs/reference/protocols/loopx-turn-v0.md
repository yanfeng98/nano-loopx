# LoopX Governed Turn v0

Status: experimental protocol and implementation target.

`loopx_turn_v0` defines how LoopX can govern one bounded turn executed by an
external agent-loop host, such as Codex CLI, without turning that host into a
second control plane. LoopX remains authoritative for goal state, todos,
claims, gates, quota, scheduler hints, and compact evidence. The host owns
model execution, tools, and an opaque resumable session handle.

The protocol is host-neutral. A Codex CLI adapter is the first target, but the
driver lifecycle must not depend on Codex-specific session files, transcript
formats, or benchmark task schemas.

## Authority Boundary

| Concern | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Goal, todo, claim, gate, quota, and cadence | LoopX CLI and registry-backed state |
| Session creation, resume, cancellation, and tool execution | External host adapter |
| Repository write isolation | LoopX workspace guard plus repository policy |
| Validation | Task-specific validator selected by the agent or adapter |
| Durable outcome and quota spend | LoopX writeback after validation |

The host must not infer a different action from status prose. It consumes a
fresh `loopx_turn_envelope_v0` decision and preserves its action signature.
Full quota/status detail remains available through the envelope cold-path
references.

## Turn Lifecycle

One driver tick has exactly these ordered phases:

1. **Wake**: resolve `goal_id`, registered `agent_id`, host kind, explicit
   execution mode, available capabilities, and an optional opaque session
   handle.
2. **Decide**: run live `quota should-run --turn-envelope` with the observed
   capabilities. A fixture is valid only in tests and shadow replay.
3. **Route**: obey the envelope without invoking the host when the user channel
   requires action, work is throttled, a monitor is unchanged, or delivery is
   otherwise disallowed. Apply and acknowledge scheduler-only changes without
   spending quota.
4. **Prepare**: preserve the selected todo identity, claim or lease when the
   contract requires it, and satisfy the workspace guard before any repository
   write.
5. **Execute**: resume the declared host session when possible, or create a new
   session only when the execution mode permits it. Give the host the thin task
   body plus the current envelope, and request one bounded work segment.
6. **Validate**: classify the host result and validate the claimed artifact or
   state transition. Host process exit zero is not validation.
7. **Write back**: update or complete the current todo, create a repair or
   successor todo when required, and refresh state with compact public-safe
   evidence.
8. **Spend and schedule**: spend one quota slot only after validated writeback,
   then apply and acknowledge the latest scheduler hint. Cadence-only work does
   not spend quota.

The driver may stop after any phase. A stop must return a typed result and must
not silently continue with a different execution mode.

## Turn Input

The driver input is a small composition of existing contracts:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "loopx_turn_request_v0",
  "goal_id": "example-goal",
  "agent_id": "codex-worker",
  "host": {
    "kind": "codex_cli",
    "execution_mode": "interactive_visible",
    "session_handle": "opaque-local-handle"
  },
  "wake": {
    "reason": "scheduler_due",
    "turn_key": "stable-idempotency-key",
    "available_capabilities": ["shell", "filesystem_write"]
  },
  "decision": {
    "schema_version": "loopx_turn_envelope_v0",
    "action_signature": {
      "matches": true
    }
  }
}
```

`session_handle` is local adapter state. It must not be committed, copied into
LoopX public state, or treated as identity authority. The stable control-plane
identity is `(goal_id, agent_id, selected_todo.todo_id)`.

Adapters may support two explicit execution modes:

- `interactive_visible`: user-visible and interruptible; never falls back to
  hidden execution.
- `isolated_headless`: an explicitly selected experiment or worker mode in an
  isolated workspace; never claims to preserve an interactive TUI.

Mode selection is input policy, not a retry heuristic.

## Typed Result

Every attempted tick returns one result kind:

| Result kind | Meaning | Required next state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validated_progress` | One bounded segment produced validated evidence. | Update current todo, refresh, spend once. |
| `validated_completion` | Acceptance for the current todo is met. | Complete todo, link a successor or record no-follow-up, refresh, spend once. |
| `repair_required` | The todo remains sound but a recoverable execution defect blocks it. | Keep or create a concrete repair todo; do not mark success. |
| `replan_required` | The current route is exhausted or incompatible while the goal acceptance gap remains. | Write a bounded todo delta or vision replan trigger. |
| `user_action_required` | A concrete user decision, payload, or credential action is projected. | Notify with the projected action in the configured operator language; no host run and no spend. |
| `wait` | Quota, monitor, scheduler, or another typed wait contract applies. | Preserve state, apply cadence if needed, no spend. |
| `host_failure` | The host could not start, resume, or finish a turn. | Record the failure class and retry or repair policy. |
| `validation_failed` | Host output exists but task validation failed or is inconclusive. | Preserve failure evidence and route to repair/replan. |
| `writeback_failed` | Validated work could not be durably recorded. | Do not spend; retry idempotent writeback before more delivery. |

`repair_required` and `replan_required` are distinct. Repair preserves the
current task intent. Replan changes the runnable todo set or route because the
existing task no longer advances the goal. Replan is required when any of the
following is true:

- no runnable todo exists while the active vision still has an acceptance gap;
- the selected todo is terminal, obsolete, or incompatible with observed host
  capabilities;
- validated negative evidence invalidates the current route; or
- two eligible turns produce no material progress through the same route.

A driver must not terminate merely because one todo ended. Goal termination
requires goal acceptance evidence, an explicit user stop, or a typed blocked
state with a concrete projected action.

## Recoverable Failure Classes

| Failure class | Driver behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `auth_required` | Stop for the concrete credential action; never read or upload credentials. |
| `session_unavailable` | Return `host_failure`; retry resume or start a new session only if the selected mode permits it. |
| `capability_missing` | Re-run decision with observed capabilities and use capability repair routing, not a fabricated user gate. |
| `workspace_guard_denied` | Repair or relocate the workspace before writes. |
| `executor_timeout` or `transport_lost` | Return `host_failure` with bounded retry metadata; do not infer completion. |
| `result_missing` | Return `validation_failed`; a process exit without typed result is inconclusive. |
| `validation_failed` | Preserve compact negative evidence and choose repair or replan. |
| `writeback_failed` | Retry idempotent writeback; never spend first. |
| `scheduler_apply_failed` | Preserve completed writeback, record cadence failure, and retry scheduler control without a delivery spend. |

## Adapter Requirements

An external host adapter must provide:

- capability discovery that can be passed to `--available-capability`;
- start, resume, cancel, and bounded-timeout operations;
- a public-safe typed result channel separate from raw transcript output;
- an explicit execution mode and no silent mode fallback;
- an opaque local session handle with no authority beyond host resume;
- visibility and idle proof before injecting into an interactive session; and
- deterministic failure mapping to the result and failure classes above.

The driver may discard raw stdout and stderr, but it must not mistake their
absence for a typed result. Raw prompts, transcripts, benchmark task text,
verifier tails, credentials, and local session paths stay outside committed
fixtures and LoopX state.

## Promotion Gates

The protocol remains experimental until all of these are true:

1. shadow replay preserves the live TurnEnvelope action signature across
   delivery, user gate, monitor wait, capability repair, workspace repair,
   replan, blocked, and throttled states;
2. one real host adapter proves start/resume, typed result, validation,
   idempotent writeback, spend ordering, and scheduler acknowledgement;
3. interactive and isolated-headless modes fail closed without switching into
   each other;
4. a controlled benchmark dogfood run shows source, budget, concurrency, and
   no-feedback boundaries remain comparable; and
5. rollback can disable the adapter while leaving normal LoopX CLI state and
   Codex App heartbeat operation intact.

This protocol does not authorize benchmark launch, leaderboard submission,
production writes, credential handling, or default replacement of Codex App.
