# pr_review_command_v0

`pr_review_command_v0` defines the `/loopx-pr-review` command. It helps a
user review open and recently merged pull requests one by one by turning public
GitHub PR metadata into a guided review queue.

The reviewed repository is the caller's current GitHub project by default, as
resolved by `gh`, or the explicit `--repo owner/repo` target. LoopX's own
repository may be used for dogfood and public fixtures, but the command is not
LoopX-repo-specific.

The command is read-only. It does not approve reviews, post PR comments, merge,
push, spend LoopX quota, or mark LoopX todos complete.

## Command

| Command | CLI reference | Intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/loopx-pr-review` | `loopx pr-review [--repo owner/repo] [--state open\|merged\|all] [--since ISO]` | List open and merged PRs for the current project or explicit repository and provide a blank five-block review template for each PR. Agentloop reads the PR body/diff and fills the review. |

The slash command must run the CLI first. Agentloop must not reconstruct the
review window by manually calling `gh pr view` / `gh pr list` for every PR. The
CLI packet's `review_groups.unmerged`, `review_groups.merged`, and
`pull_requests[].review_template` are the authoritative queue. The packet's
`evidence_commands` are for the second step: reading one selected PR deeply.

When `--state all` is used, the command must preserve both lifecycle groups.
The `--limit` value is applied per group so a busy open queue cannot consume the
whole packet and make `review_groups.merged` empty while merged PRs exist in the
window. Live GitHub reads should fetch open and closed/merged windows
separately before constructing the grouped packet.

## Source Reads

Implementations may read compact public PR surfaces:

- pull request title, number, URL, branch, author, lifecycle state, merge time,
  and review decision;
- PR body summary;
- changed-file list and diff scale;
- status-check rollup;
- merge-state metadata.

Commit headlines may be used as optional single-PR deep-review evidence, but
the default window review should not require fetching them for every PR.

They must not include raw logs, private connector payloads, credentials, local
absolute paths, private source bodies, or hidden CI artifacts.

## Review Flow

The packet should let a reviewer move through PRs in order:

1. Start from `review_groups.unmerged` for PRs that can still affect merge
   decisions.
2. Then use `review_groups.merged` for post-merge audit and follow-up quality.
3. Use `evidence_commands`, key files, changed-file scale, and checks to open
   the actual PR body and diff.
4. Let agentloop fill the blank five-block template:
   `动机`, `改动思路`, `具体改动`, `对主干的风险`, `我的整体评价`.
5. Treat `metadata_risk_hint` only as queue-ordering metadata. It must not be
   copied as the final risk judgement.
6. Decide `approve`, `request changes`, `defer`, or `merge after checks`.

## Acceptance Checks

A first implementation is acceptable when:

- `loopx slash-commands` exposes `/loopx-pr-review`;
- `loopx pr-review` returns `loopx_pr_review_command_response_v0`;
- default live reads use the caller's current `gh` repository, while
  `--repo owner/repo` can review another GitHub project;
- `--state all` includes merged PRs in the same packet, applies `--limit` per
  lifecycle group, and keeps `review_groups.merged` non-empty when merged PRs
  exist in the requested window; `--state open` preserves the old open-only
  review queue;
- `--since` can bound an overnight or release-window review without relying on
  private chat memory;
- the response includes review sequence, changed-file scope, status checks,
  key files, risk notes, metadata-only risk hints, evidence commands, explicit
  `review_groups.unmerged` / `review_groups.merged`, and a blank five-block
  review template;
- the slash-command catalog marks `/loopx-pr-review` as `must_run_cli_first`
  and says manual `gh` calls are only per-PR deep-read commands after the CLI
  packet selects a PR;
- each PR includes `review_template.sections` for `动机`, `改动思路`,
  `具体改动`, `对主干的风险`, and `我的整体评价`;
- template sections must leave `content` empty so agentloop reads the real PR
  before writing the review;
- `metadata_risk_hint` must be repository-generic and must not special-case
  LoopX files or domains;
- live GitHub reads and fixture-based smokes share the same schema;
- no raw logs, private payloads, credentials, local paths, or private source
  bodies are recorded.
