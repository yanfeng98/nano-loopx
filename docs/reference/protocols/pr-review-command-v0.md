# pr_review_command_v0

`pr_review_command_v0` defines the `/loopx-pr-review` command. It helps a
user review open and recently merged pull requests one by one by turning public
GitHub PR metadata into a guided review queue.

The reviewed repository is the caller's current GitHub project by default, as
resolved by `gh`, or the explicit `--repo owner/repo` target. LoopX's own
repository may be used for dogfood and public fixtures, but the command is not
LoopX-repo-specific.

The command is read-only. It does not approve reviews, post PR comments, merge,
push, spend LoopX quota, or mark LoopX todos complete.

## Command

| Command | CLI reference | Intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/loopx-pr-review` | `loopx pr-review [--repo owner/repo] [--state open\|merged\|all] [--since ISO]` | List open and merged PRs for the current project or explicit repository and build a guided review packet with motivation, change scope, checks, risks, and review prompts. |

## Source Reads

Implementations may read compact public PR surfaces:

- pull request title, number, URL, branch, author, lifecycle state, merge time,
  and review decision;
- PR body summary;
- changed-file list and diff scale;
- commit headlines;
- status-check rollup;
- merge-state metadata.

They must not include raw logs, private connector payloads, credentials, local
absolute paths, private source bodies, or hidden CI artifacts.

## Review Flow

The packet should let a reviewer move through PRs in order:

1. Read the motivation and decide whether the PR should exist.
2. Compare the touched areas and key files with that scope.
3. Inspect validation and risk notes before approval or merge handoff.
4. Decide `approve`, `request changes`, `defer`, or `merge after checks`.

## Acceptance Checks

A first implementation is acceptable when:

- `loopx slash-commands` exposes `/loopx-pr-review`;
- `loopx pr-review` returns `loopx_pr_review_command_response_v0`;
- default live reads use the caller's current `gh` repository, while
  `--repo owner/repo` can review another GitHub project;
- `--state all` includes merged PRs in the same packet, while `--state open`
  preserves the old open-only review queue;
- `--since` can bound an overnight or release-window review without relying on
  private chat memory;
- the response includes review sequence, motivation, changed-file scope,
  status checks, risk notes, and review prompts;
- live GitHub reads and fixture-based smokes share the same schema;
- no raw logs, private payloads, credentials, local paths, or private source
  bodies are recorded.
