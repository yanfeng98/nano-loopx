# long_horizon_agent_state_protocol_v0

`long_horizon_agent_state_protocol_v0` is a shared lifecycle map for
long-running LoopX agent work. It separates durable source state from
operator-facing projections, then shows how startup, execution, ending,
evidence, gates, human feedback, handoffs, and rollback should connect.

This is not a new state store. The source of truth remains the registry, active
goal state, todos, run history, rollout events, operator gates, and run-bound
human reward overlays. This protocol gives those existing surfaces one
implementation-oriented frame.

## Product Outcomes

The protocol exists so LoopX can support these outcomes:

1. A new project can connect quickly without overwriting an existing control
   plane.
2. The user sees candidate work and gates before a long loop starts.
3. Multiple agents can work in lanes without losing ownership, evidence, or
   review responsibility.
4. The operator can inspect progress, gates, risk, and next actions from
   projections instead of reading every chat thread.
5. Failed or reverted work becomes a compensating state transition, not erased
   history.

## Source Protocol

Source protocol fields are writable only through LoopX lifecycle commands or
project-owned state files. Dashboards and showcase fixtures must not mutate
them directly.

| Source state | Existing anchor | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `goal_identity` | registry, active state, agent profile docs | Stable `goal_id`, repo, primary agent, side-agent scopes, and write boundary. |
| `connection_state` | `loopx connect`, `bootstrap`, `doctor`, `sync-global` | Whether the repo is connected, read-only, bootstrapped, stale, or missing local state. |
| `local_state_boundary` | `.gitignore`, `loopx check`, getting-started docs | Keep `.loopx/`, `.codex/goals/`, `.local/`, raw logs, credentials, and private paths out of public commits. |
| `todo_item_v0` | `loopx todo`, active-state todo sections, `loopx/status.py` | Formal work unit with role, status, task class, action kind, claim, dependency, resume, and evidence metadata. |
| `suggested_todo` | `loopx todo suggest`, `todo_suggestion_prompt_v0` | Candidate decision queue; not formal backlog until promoted by user/controller. |
| `interaction_contract_v0` | `loopx quota should-run`, `docs/quota-allocation.md` | Splits user, agent, and CLI obligations before an automated turn spends compute. |
| `agent_lane_next_action_v0` | `loopx quota should-run --agent-id ...`, `docs/project-agent-todo-contract.md` | Per-agent selected runnable todo without replacing the goal-level next action. |
| `side_agent_workspace_guard_v0` | `loopx quota should-run`, side-agent registry scope | Blocks normal delivery until a side agent uses an independent worktree/branch. |
| `run_history` | `loopx/history.py`, `refresh-state`, `quota spend-slot` | Compact run classifications, delivery outcome, recommended action, evidence, and spend records. |
| `loopx_rollout_event_v0` | `loopx/rollout_event_log.py` | Append-only public-safe event stream for todo, validation, PR, handoff, quota, repair, and failure events. |
| `operator_gate` | `loopx operator-gate`, `loopx/review_packet.py`, `loopx/status.py` | User/controller decision point with decision, reason, follow-up, and optional handoff command. |
| `human_reward` | `loopx reward`, `loopx/history.py`, `loopx/status.py` | Run-bound human judgment overlay; not generic write-control. |
| `delivery_outcome` | `loopx/delivery_outcome.py`, `loopx/history.py`, `loopx/status.py` | Machine-readable result tier: surface-only, outcome gap, outcome progress, or primary goal outcome. |
| `rollback_packet_v0` | `docs/reference/protocols/rollback-packet-v0.md` | Compensating action record linking todo, commit, event, decision, external resource, and validation plan. |

## Projection Protocol

Projection protocol fields are read-only views. They may summarize, rank, and
compress state, but they do not own truth or grant permission.

| Projection | Existing anchor | Display use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status_contract_v2` | `loopx status`, `docs/status-data-contract.md` | CLI/dashboard status envelope. |
| `goal_channel_projection_v0` | `loopx/frontstage.py`, `loopx/status.py` | First-screen goal card: user todos, agent todos, open gates, active claims, latest event, next action. |
| `todo_index_v0` | `loopx/status.py` | Cross-goal todo index from attention queue and rollout events. |
| `task_graph_projection_v0` | `docs/reference/protocols/task-graph-projection-v0.md` | Optional graph of blocks, validates, repairs, hands off, and supersedes. |
| `review_packet` | `loopx review-packet`, `loopx/review_packet.py` | Operator-facing gate/review/handoff packet. |
| `global_manager_command_v0` | `docs/reference/protocols/global-manager-command-v0.md` | Read-first global command response for progress, gates, todos, risks, and next actions. |
| `frontstage dashboard` | `apps/dashboard/src/views/frontstage-page.tsx` | Dense operator UI for lanes, gates, todos, recent evidence, and risks. |

## Lifecycle

### Startup

Startup answers whether the project is connected, who owns the work, and what
the first safe decision is.

Required source state:

- stable `goal_id`;
- primary agent and side-agent scope when registered;
- adapter status and project-local state path;
- local-state ignore boundary;
- optional suggested todo queue;
- optional first formal runnable todo.

Projection requirements:

- show goal id, current user gate, top agent todo, and next safe action;
- distinguish candidate todo from formal todo;
- report local-state ignore problems as warnings;
- install heartbeat only after a connected goal exists.

### Execution

Execution answers whether this turn should run, what exactly should be done,
who owns it, and when compute can be spent.

Required source state:

- `interaction_contract_v0.user_channel`;
- `interaction_contract_v0.agent_channel`;
- `interaction_contract_v0.cli_channel`;
- selected `agent_lane_next_action_v0`;
- selected `todo_item_v0`;
- claim or lane ownership when multiple agents are registered;
- validation artifact refs after work;
- compact writeback before quota spend.

Projection requirements:

- user-required work must name concrete user todos or questions;
- no user todo plus `agent_channel.must_attempt=true` must not become a quiet
  no-op;
- safe-bypass work must keep the blocking gate visible;
- monitor todos stay visible but do not rewrite generic heartbeat prompts;
- `delivery_outcome` is displayed separately from activity count.

### Ending

Ending answers whether work completed, paused, failed, handed off, or must be
rolled back.

Required source state:

- `delivery_outcome`;
- completed, superseded, blocked, or deferred todo status;
- successor todo or explicit no-follow-up rationale;
- validation evidence or blocker evidence;
- PR/commit refs when code changed;
- handoff target and stop condition when another agent should continue;
- future `rollback_packet_v0` when state must be compensated.

Projection requirements:

- show the result tier before showing activity volume;
- keep failed external-resource setup as a partial-success state when a usable
  resource exists;
- show handoff/review ownership rather than treating every open todo as global;
- expose rollback candidates without executing rollback automatically.

## Evidence, Gate, Reward, Handoff

Evidence fields should be compact and public-safe:

- `artifact_refs`: docs, smoke files, fixture files, PRs, commits, dashboards;
- `validation_commands`: command labels or public-safe paths, not raw logs;
- `source_refs`: issue/PR ids, public social ids, redacted private connector
  ids, experiment run handles;
- `boundary`: booleans proving raw logs, credentials, private paths, and raw
  transcripts are absent.

Gate fields must include:

- gate owner class: `user`, `controller`, `primary_agent`, or external system;
- blocked todo or scope;
- question or decision required;
- approved/deferred/rejected status;
- unblocked todo or next safe action when resolved.

Reward fields must remain run-bound:

- judged run id or generated timestamp;
- decision label and reward polarity;
- public-safe reason summary;
- follow-up;
- optional active-state summary.

Handoff fields must include:

- source agent and target agent;
- todo ids or scope transferred;
- stop condition;
- evidence refs the target needs;
- whether review or self-merge is allowed.

## Implementation Alignment

Already aligned:

- `loopx quota should-run` emits `interaction_contract_v0` and
  `agent_lane_next_action_v0`.
- `loopx todo` supports formal todos, claims, deferred state,
  `resume_when=todo_done:<todo_id>`, `unblocks_todo_id`, and suggestions.
- `loopx status` emits `goal_channel_projection_v0`, `todo_index_v0`, compact
  operator gates, compact human rewards, delivery outcomes, and rollout-event
  todo indexes.
- `loopx_rollout_event_v0` can carry lane, transition, causality, handoff, and
  code refs for new events.
- `examples/fixtures/long-horizon-self-iteration-rollout.public.json` gives
  frontend and protocol tests a compact public-safe fixture with gate, handoff,
  validation, deferred-resume, evidence, and inferred display-bridge coverage.
- `rollback_packet_v0` defines how rollback, fix-forward, external cleanup,
  support requests, and todo compensation are represented before any protected
  action runs.

Partially aligned:

- Older rollout events may lack before/after, causality, and handoff fields, so
  any animation or timeline must mark inferred bridges explicitly.
- `task_graph_projection_v0` is specified but not yet a stable dashboard input.
- Commit-to-todo linkage is convention-based through PR text, commit messages,
  todo evidence, and rollout refs.
- `todo suggest` produces a prompt packet for the user's agent; it is not a
  fully autonomous repo analyzer.
- External-resource partial success is not yet a generic protocol.

Not yet aligned:

- `rollback_packet_v0` is specified and smoke-tested, but no command yet emits
  or executes packets.
- PR lifecycle resume conditions such as `pr_merged:#532` are not supported;
  only `resume_when=todo_done:<todo_id>` exists today.
- `global_manager_command_v0` is specified and smoke-tested, but no host
  integration or CLI command emits it yet.
- Historical human-gate impact must be inferred from public-safe evidence.
- Frontstage does not yet render a full multi-lane self-iteration timeline from
  real status plus rollout events.

## Acceptance Checks

A protocol implementation or fixture is acceptable when it proves:

- source and projection state are separated;
- projections are explicitly read-only;
- every formal execution step maps to a todo, gate, run, event, or reward;
- candidate todos are not silently promoted;
- at least one lane-aware next action can be selected for a registered agent;
- validation and writeback precede quota spend;
- human gates name what they block and unblock;
- handoffs name source agent, target agent, todo scope, and stop condition;
- rollback is represented as a future compensating action, not as hidden
  deletion;
- public fixtures contain no raw logs, raw transcripts, credentials, or local
  absolute paths.
- `python3 examples/long-horizon-self-iteration-rollout-fixture-smoke.py`
  passes before a fixture is used as UI input.
