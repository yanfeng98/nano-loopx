# Reward And Gate Direct-Write Contract

Goal Harness has two operator decision writes that must stay distinct:
run-bound `human_reward` overlays and `operator_gate` decision runs. Both turn a
human decision into durable runtime evidence, but neither grants write-control,
production access, or permission to skip the next state/registry/quota read.

This document defines the minimal `decision_write_contract_v0` planning slice for
local operator decisions. It is intentionally narrow: use existing CLI and
loopback preview/apply paths before adding any new dashboard control.

## Contract Fields

Every direct-write decision path must expose these public-safe fields before a
write is enabled:

- `decision_kind`: `human_reward` or `operator_gate`.
- `goal_id`: exact goal id.
- `target_ref`: exact selected run timestamp for `human_reward`, or exact
  `gate_id` for `operator_gate`.
- `decision`: compact public-safe decision string.
- `reason_summary`: one compact public-safe reason.
- `follow_up`: optional public-safe next condition.
- `preview_id`: required for browser reward append; omitted for CLI-only gate
  append until a separate gate preview endpoint exists.
- `source_of_truth`: `run_bound_human_reward_overlay` or
  `operator_gate_decision_run`.
- `write_effect`: what will be appended and what remains unchanged.
- `project_agent_visibility`: the read path a target project agent should use
  after the write.

Unknown fields and private-looking text must be rejected instead of silently
ignored.

## Human Reward

`human_reward` judges one exact run or route outcome. The canonical writer is
`goal-harness reward`; local dashboards may validate the same compact payload via
`POST /reward/dry-run`.

Browser append is allowed only when all of these are true:

- `serve-status` is running on loopback.
- The server was started with `--enable-reward-write-api`.
- The append request reuses the exact `preview_id` from `/reward/dry-run`.
- The selected `run_generated_at`, compact reward payload, and raw index count
  still match the preview.

Successful append writes one run-bound `human_reward` overlay row. Active state
may carry a summary, but the run overlay remains the durable source of truth.

## Operator Gate

`operator_gate` answers whether a gated handoff or command may proceed. The
canonical writer is `goal-harness operator-gate`. The review packet may show a
local `operator_gate_dry_run_command`, but that command belongs to the operator
or controller, not to the target project agent.

There is no dashboard `operator_gate` apply endpoint in this contract. Before
adding one, implement a separate stale-preview handshake equivalent to reward
append and prove that the target agent sees only an approved handoff after the
gate decision run exists.

Approved gates must include an `operator_gate_resume_contract` with the fresh
state check. The receiving agent must re-read current registry, active state,
quota, repo snapshot, policy, and run status before executing the approved
command.

## Dashboard Boundary

The default dashboard remains read-mostly:

- It may render status, run history, review packets, reward CLI drafts,
  `/reward/dry-run`, and control-plane setting dry-runs.
- It may append reward only through loopback `--enable-reward-write-api`.
- It must not expose gate append, reward append, or control-plane apply unless
  the corresponding explicit local write API is enabled.

Adding a new write surface requires a smoke that proves disabled-by-default
behavior, stale-preview rejection, public-safe text validation, exactly one
runtime append, status refresh, and no local path leakage in compact responses.
