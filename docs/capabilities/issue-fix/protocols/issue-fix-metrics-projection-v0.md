# Issue-Fix Metrics Projection v0

## Purpose

`loopx issue-fix metrics` produces a read-only reporting packet for a long-running
issue-fix goal. It answers two different questions without mixing them:

1. how the public repository changed during the reporting window; and
2. what outputs are attributable to the connected issue-fix goal.

The command derives agent output from the goal's existing feasibility and PR
lifecycle domain state. It does not create a metrics ledger or lifecycle state
machine.

## Repository snapshot input

Both period-start and current inputs use
`issue_fix_repository_reporting_snapshot_v0`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "issue_fix_repository_reporting_snapshot_v0",
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "captured_at": "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "source_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
  "open_issues": 42,
  "open_pull_requests": 17
}
```

The current snapshot additionally requires `flow_since_baseline`:

```json
{
  "flow_since_baseline": {
    "issues_opened": 8,
    "issues_closed": 6,
    "pull_requests_opened": 12,
    "pull_requests_closed": 10,
    "pull_requests_merged": 9
  }
}
```

LoopX rejects a snapshot unless both stock equations reconcile:

```text
baseline open + opened - closed = current open
```

Optional `issue_states` and `pull_request_states` contain compact public current
state. They let the projection compute issue-close attribution and refresh stale
PR state without rewriting lifecycle history. Every output inventory row records
whether its current state came from the lifecycle ledger or the newer repository
snapshot.

## Supplemental counts

`issue_fix_metrics_supplement_v0` can supply public-safe counts that are not yet
native to feasibility or PR lifecycle rows:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "issue_fix_metrics_supplement_v0",
  "counts": {
    "human_interventions": 2,
    "first_push_ci_passed": 5,
    "first_push_ci_total": 7,
    "loopx_capability_gaps_found": 3,
    "loopx_capability_gaps_fixed": 2,
    "memory_retrievals": 4,
    "memory_verified_patch_influence": 1,
    "memory_stale_results": 1,
    "issue_close_recommendations": 3,
    "issue_close_requests_published": 2,
    "issue_closes_observed": 1,
    "issue_reopens_observed": 0
  }
}
```

This is an allowlisted compact input, not a raw provider payload. Missing counts
remain `null` and produce a `missing_data` reason code. A missing measure is never
coerced to zero.

`loopx issue-fix metrics-supplement` composes that input from evidence already
owned by the issue-fix domain state and from optional explicit event evidence:

```bash
loopx --format json issue-fix metrics-supplement \
  --goal-id public-issue-fix-goal \
  --project /path/to/project \
  --repo public-org/public-repo \
  --period-start 2026-07-01T00:00:00Z \
  --period-end 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z \
  --human-intervention-coverage-start 2026-07-01T00:00:00Z \
  --capability-gap-coverage-start 2026-07-01T00:00:00Z \
  --event-json /path/to/public-safe-events.json \
  --repository-memory-json /path/to/explicit-memory-read-result.json
```

Feasibility and lifecycle rows supply screened issues, triage outcomes, and
automatic terminal closeouts. Explicit repository-memory read results supply
retrieval, verified patch-influence, and stale-result counts. An optional
`issue_fix_metrics_event_batch_v0` supplies stable event identities for
first-push CI, human interventions, useful public comments, duplicate external
writes, and capability-gap `found` / `fixed` / `real_callsite_verified`
transitions. It also accepts four explicit issue-close stages:
`issue_close_recommended`, `issue_close_request_published`,
`issue_closed_observed`, and `issue_reopened_observed`. Events outside the
reporting period are ignored, duplicate event identities are rejected, and a
capability gap is counted once per gap identity.

Issue-close events require `issue_ref`. Published requests and provider-observed
close/reopen transitions additionally require a public HTTPS `evidence_url`;
an internal recommendation does not. The composer folds repeated events into
one `issue_fix_issue_close_activity_v0` row per issue, retaining only stable event
identity, stage, timestamp, and public evidence URL. For example:

```json
{
  "event_id": "close-request-42",
  "event_type": "issue_close_request_published",
  "issue_ref": "issues_42",
  "occurred_at": "2026-07-12T00:00:00Z",
  "evidence_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42#issuecomment-1"
}
```

Without an explicit event batch, the composer reads the existing compact LoopX
run index and counts only route-changing `operator_gate_*` decisions and
run-bound `human_reward` entries carrying a `human_reward_lesson_v0` correction.
Passive chat, acknowledgements, and ordinary positive feedback are not counted.
The count is published only when `--human-intervention-coverage-start` proves
that this audited source covers the whole reporting period. A later or absent
coverage start exposes the observed count only under
`coverage.human_intervention` and keeps the metric unavailable, so older
unprojected conversations are never reconstructed or silently treated as zero.

Capability gaps can use the same no-guessing path without a hand-authored event
batch. An agent marks an existing agent todo explicitly:

```bash
loopx todo update \
  --goal-id public-issue-fix-goal \
  --todo-id todo_gap_id \
  --role agent \
  --target-capability issue_fix_monthly_metrics \
  --capability-gap-status real_callsite_verified \
  --evidence 'PR merged and the original pilot callsite passed'
```

LoopX appends a typed `capability_gap` rollout event; the todo id is the stable
gap identity and the existing target-capability metadata remains the human
work surface. The composer folds `found`, `fixed`, and
`real_callsite_verified` transitions once per todo. It publishes the three
counts only when `--capability-gap-coverage-start` covers the reporting period;
otherwise `coverage.capability_gap` exposes partial observation and the counts
stay unavailable. Backdating that coverage is valid only after auditing and
backfilling every in-period gap todo. `fixed` and `real_callsite_verified`
markers require public-safe evidence; `found` may be recorded before a fix
artifact exists.

PR lifecycle collection also captures first-push CI evidence without another
ledger when public metadata proves that the PR still has exactly one commit and
its check rollup is terminal (`PASSING` or `FAILING`). The compact evidence is
preserved across later lifecycle upserts. The supplement reports
`coverage.first_push_ci` and only publishes pass/total counts when every PR in
the reporting cohort has evidence. Partial observation stays unavailable and
surfaces its observed/eligible coverage instead of reporting a biased rate.

The composer performs no provider call and does not infer absent events. When no
explicit memory result is supplied, it may use a compact feasibility memory hook
only when that hook records `read_performed=true`; otherwise memory fields remain
absent. With no event batch, useful-comment, duplicate-write, and other
event-backed fields remain absent; only coverage-gated human-intervention and
typed capability-gap rollout evidence can be composed from existing LoopX
sources. In both cases `loopx issue-fix metrics` reports unavailable evidence
rather than coercing it to zero.

## Attribution contract

- The repository baseline contains repository stock only.
- Agent output at the goal-start baseline is zero.
- Feasibility rows provide selected issues and route counts.
- PR lifecycle rows provide the attributable PR inventory, links, receipts, and
  last persisted state.
- Reporting-window attribution uses the newest verified lifecycle event time
  (`created_at` from the current public snapshot when present; otherwise
  `merged_at`, `closed_at`, or `updated_at`) together with the row observation
  time. A linked feasibility decision follows its attributable PR into the
  window, so an old or replayed observation timestamp cannot erase real output.
- Unlinked feasibility or lifecycle rows whose available event times all
  predate the baseline are excluded from the period instead of forcing the
  caller to rewrite history.
- A newer current public snapshot may refresh state but cannot add an
  unattributed PR to the inventory.
- Repository shares use explicit numerators and denominators, so a ratio is
  `not_available` when its denominator is zero or evidence is missing.
- Open PRs are work in progress, not terminal outcomes.
- A recommendation is activity, not a close. A published request is an
  externally visible attempt, not a close. `issue_closes_observed` requires a
  later provider-observed close event or a later `closed_at` in the current
  repository snapshot.
- An attributed close conversion requires a published request at or before the
  observed close. This is a bounded operational attribution rule, not a causal
  claim about why a maintainer closed the issue.
- A later observed reopen is a reversal. The packet reports gross attributed
  conversions, reopen reversals, and net conversions separately. Each measure
  counts unique issue refs, so retries and repeated comments cannot inflate it.
- PR-linked issue closes and close-activity conversions are overlapping views;
  they must not be added together as independent terminal outcomes.

## Boundary contract

The projection performs no network read and no external write. Inputs are
caller-supplied compact public metadata. Output excludes local paths, credentials,
raw issue bodies, comments, provider responses, transcripts, and tool logs.

Daily public snapshot collection and Kanban/dashboard rendering are separate
adapters over this packet. They must not become a second source of truth.

`loopx issue-fix repository-snapshot` is the bounded public GitHub collector.
It reads repository stock/flow plus the current state of issue/PR references
already present in the goal's issue-fix domain state. The command never retains
raw provider payloads. With `--retain-material-snapshot`, it writes at most one
row per day to the existing `issue_fix/repository-snapshots.jsonl` stream and
skips the write when stock, flow, issue state, PR state, CI, and review are
unchanged:

```bash
loopx --format json issue-fix repository-snapshot \
  --goal-id public-issue-fix-goal \
  --project /path/to/connected/project \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --repository-baseline-json baseline.json \
  --fetch-public-github \
  --retain-material-snapshot
```

The returned `snapshot` object can be passed directly as
`--repository-current-json` to `loopx issue-fix metrics`. Scheduling remains a
normal LoopX `continuous_monitor` todo; the collector does not install a second
scheduler or invent another workflow state machine.

## Monthly Impact projection

The metrics packet includes stable `impact_rows` for repository health,
delivery, quality, autonomy, capability, and memory. Every row keeps its
baseline, current value, delta, numerator/denominator when applicable, public
source URL, freshness timestamp, and missing-data reason.

Issue-close delivery has separate rows for recommendations, published requests,
agent-pursued closes, attributed conversions, reopen reversals, net conversions,
and conversion rate. The rows stay unavailable when the explicit event batch
does not cover the reporting period, or when an attempted issue has neither a
current issue state nor provider-observed close/reopen evidence.

Capability delta is represented by three separate rows: gaps found, gaps
fixed, and gaps verified on a real callsite. This keeps discovery volume,
delivery, and product-path proof distinguishable instead of collapsing all
three into a single success count. Each row remains `not_available` until its
own evidence-backed count is present.

Repository-memory impact is likewise represented by three separate rows:
retrieved results, results verified to influence a patch, and results verified
stale. This separates usage volume from demonstrated engineering leverage and
retrieval quality; zero is retained as evidence, while missing counts remain
`not_available`.

The generic Lark sink renders those rows into the `Monthly Impact` view without
storing another metrics ledger:

```bash
loopx --format json issue-fix metrics \
  --goal-id public-issue-fix-goal \
  --project /path/to/connected/project \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --repository-baseline-json baseline.json \
  --repository-current-json current.json \
| loopx --format json lark-kanban sync-projection \
  --projection-file - \
  --goal-id public-issue-fix-goal \
  --sink-visibility shared \
  --execute
```

`sync-projection` accepts a file, a bounded inline object, or stdin. Setup is
idempotent: existing boards gain the metric fields and `Monthly Impact` view
through the normal schema-reconciliation path.
