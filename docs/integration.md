# Integration Guide

Goal Harness should be used as a shared local base, not copied into every
project.

## Local Base

Clone or symlink one copy:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/goal-harness
python3 -m pip install -e ~/goal-harness
```

Then projects can call:

```bash
goal-harness --registry <private-registry> registry
goal-harness --registry <private-registry> history
goal-harness --registry <private-registry> check --scan-root <project-root>
```

## One-Command Project Connect

For a new project, start with:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
goal-harness bootstrap \
  --goal-id project-goal \
  --objective "Improve this project through bounded, verified goal segments."
```

`goal-harness connect` is an alias for the same operation. The command is
safe to rerun: by default it keeps an existing state file and existing registry
entry; pass `--force` only when you intentionally want to replace them.

The default files are:

```text
.goal-harness/registry.json
.codex/goals/<goal-id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md
```

In most real projects these files should be private. If they contain current
work state or local evidence, add them to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
.goal-harness/
.codex/goals/
```

## Project Adapter

A project adapter should be thin and project-specific. It may read:

- active goal state,
- git status,
- test or experiment status,
- cheap health checks,
- project-specific guards.

It should output:

- `classification`,
- exactly one `recommended_action`,
- relevant warnings,
- hard guards,
- optional run log paths.

By default it should be read-only. Launching jobs, stopping jobs, syncing docs,
or editing production state requires explicit user approval.

The bootstrap command does not create a domain adapter. It creates the minimum
registry and state contract so the first adapter can be added deliberately.

For a large project, prefer a read-only adapter map before any writes. The map
should identify authority sources, work clusters, validation surfaces, proposed
sub-agent scopes, boundary findings, and a short controller handoff packet. See
[complex-project-readonly-adapter.md](complex-project-readonly-adapter.md).

## Controller / Sub-Agent Coordination

Some Codex goal runs should use multiple sub-agents. Goal Harness should keep
that parallelism explicit:

- child runs declare `work_scope` before acting;
- overlapping write scopes require parent arbitration;
- children default to read-only unless the registry grants a write scope;
- only the controller can mark the main goal complete;
- child final reports include changed files, validation, residual risk, and
  next handoff;
- the controller performs final merge, public/private scan, and state writeback.

Minimal registry fields for this pattern are:

```json
{
  "role": "controller",
  "parent_goal_id": null,
  "spawn_policy": {
    "allowed": true,
    "max_children": 3,
    "allowed_domains": ["docs-map", "validation-map"]
  },
  "coordination": {
    "write_scope": ["docs/**", "examples/**"],
    "claim_ttl_minutes": 30,
    "requires_parent_approval": ["write", "publish", "production-action"]
  }
}
```

These fields are a public contract, not a runtime lock manager. A future version
can add claim files, stale-claim detection, and overlap warnings.

## Shared Runtime

All adapters should save compact run history under:

```text
~/.codex/goal-harness/goals/<goal-id>/runs/index.jsonl
```

This gives the app, CLI, heartbeats, and future UI one place to inspect goal
history.

## Public Repo vs Project Repo

Put generic code here:

- registry and history readers,
- contract checker,
- generic schema and docs,
- sanitized adapter examples,
- controller/sub-agent lifecycle examples.

Keep in the project repo:

- project-specific adapter code,
- active goal state,
- private registry,
- domain-specific health checks.

This split lets many local projects share one stable Goal Harness base while
keeping their real evidence and safety policies local.
