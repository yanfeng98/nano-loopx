**Loop engineering for long-running AI agents.**

**Turn static goals into dynamic, human-in-the-loop agent loops.**

**让复杂目标持续流转：人把控判断，agent 接力执行，状态不漂移。**

LoopX is a local control plane for loop engineering. It helps Codex,
Claude Code, Cursor, and other agent runtimes keep working on goals that span
hours, days, handoffs, and changing human feedback.

LoopX turns a one-shot prompt or static goal into a dynamic, reviewable loop
state: goals, gates, todos, claims, scopes, evidence, run history, quota, and
human decisions stay in one compact layer. User gates stay explicit; safe
fallback lanes keep moving; every automatic turn has a boundary, validation
surface, and writeback trail.

LoopX 把一次静态 goal 变成能持续流转的动态 loop：该等人的地方明确等人，
不该空等的安全侧路继续推进，下一轮 agent 总能读到目标、边界、证据和交接。

[3-minute demo script](docs/outreach/frontstage-demo-script.md) is for
presenters who need a timed walkthrough.

## What Is It?

LoopX does not replace Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another agent
runtime. It sits above them as a loop-engineering control plane: the runtime
executes bounded agent loops, while LoopX preserves the dynamic goal state those
loops need to keep working without losing the plot.

Short answer: LoopX is not another executor. Codex goal, Codex App
automation, CLI scripts, cron jobs, or a human-visible TUI can trigger the next
executor loop; LoopX keeps the goal, gate, evidence, quota, and handoff contract
stable across those turns.

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Codex / Claude Code / Cursor | Execute a bounded agent loop: read, write, run commands, and respond. |
| Goal mode / automation / CLI scripts / TUI | Trigger or schedule the next executor loop. |
| LoopX | Preserve the dynamic loop state: gates, todos, run history, quota, evidence, boundaries, and handoff state. |

The product promise is not "more todo lists." It is a practical foundation for
loop engineering: keep human judgment at high-value decision points, keep safe
fallback work moving when one lane is gated, and stop compute spend when a turn
cannot produce a verified transition.

Put differently: LoopX lets a user's agent team keep working across tools,
turns, and off-hours without turning the project into a pile of hidden scripts
and stale prompts. The technical contract underneath that promise is explicit:
agent identity, todo ownership, scope, capability gates, quota, evidence
writeback, and public/private boundaries stay visible to the next turn.

## Why Loop Engineering Needs A Control Plane

Short agent tasks usually fail because the model makes a bad local choice.
Long-running loops fail differently: state drifts.

Loop engineering often begins with a timer, a long prompt, a shell script, or a
visible TUI session. That can prove the idea, but it is not enough for real
work. Once the goal changes, the user gives feedback, an owner gate appears, or
multiple agents touch the same repo, the loop needs shared state instead of
chat memory.

After several runs, several projects, or several handoffs, the hard questions
become:

- What is the current objective, and what is explicitly out of scope?
- Which owner decision, source document, run artifact, or benchmark result is
  the current authority?
- What did the last agent run actually do, and how was it validated?
- Which next action belongs to the human, and which belongs to the agent?
- Which actions are safe read-only work, and which cross write, production,
  private-data, or publication boundaries?
- How does human feedback survive into the next run?

LoopX makes those questions machine-readable enough for agents and legible
enough for operators, so a loop can run longer without becoming less
accountable.

## What You Get

- **Lifetime goals**: durable project intentions that outlive one chat thread,
  run, todo, or implementation plan. A lifetime goal does not grant open-ended
  autonomy: only the next bounded transition is executable.
- **User gates**: concrete human decisions that stay visible instead of
  disappearing into chat.
- **Safe fallback**: audited side paths that can continue when one lane is
  gated, without bypassing the gate.
- **Todo ownership**: user and agent todos with `claimed_by` for multi-agent
  coordination.
- **Quota and steering**: a guard that says whether an automatic turn should
  run, wait, ask the user, self-repair, or stay quiet.
- **Run history and evidence**: compact append-only events for progress,
  validation, blockers, reward, benchmark results, and quota spend.
- **Public/private boundary checks**: local scans and docs rules to keep raw
  private state, credentials, logs, traces, and benchmark material out of
  public artifacts.

## Good Fits

Use LoopX when agent work spans time, people, projects, or safety
boundaries:

- multi-day or multi-week engineering and research goals;
- recurring heartbeat or monitor-style agent turns;
- benchmark and experiment loops that must wait for evidence;
- projects with owner/SOP gates or human reward judgments;
- controller agents that spawn scoped side agents;
- creator, research, or operations workflows where non-engineering users need
  agent progress translated into clear state, blockers, and feedback prompts;
- public/private boundary checks before publishing artifacts;
- local dashboards that should foreground user decisions before raw logs.

Do not use LoopX as an autonomous production controller. It is a local
coordination substrate; project ownership and dangerous permissions stay with
the human/operator.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Python 3.11+, `curl`, `tar`, macOS or Linux shell. Git is only
needed for contributor clone/canary workflows. The Python package has no
runtime dependencies outside the standard library.

The easiest start is agent-first: ask the agent you already use to install,
connect, diagnose, and show the next safe action before doing longer work.

### Codex App

Best when you want LoopX to keep working through Codex App heartbeats. Paste
this from the project repo:

```text
Install and connect LoopX for this project end to end. Do not stop at a
plan. If `loopx` is missing, install it with the official no-clone
GitHub installer. Then run doctor, connect or bootstrap this repo, ensure local
LoopX state is ignored, and report the goal id, current user gate, top
agent todo, and next safe action before longer work. After the project is
connected, set or refresh this thread's heartbeat automation from
`loopx heartbeat-prompt --thin`.
```

After the project is connected, the agent should install the generated
heartbeat body:

```bash
loopx heartbeat-prompt --thin --goal-id <goal-id> --agent-id <agent-id> --agent-scope "<scope>"
```

### Codex CLI

Best when the visible TUI should stay primary. Open Codex CLI from your project
repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
codex
```

Then paste one setup message:

```text
Install and connect LoopX for this repo from this visible Codex CLI TUI.
If `loopx` is missing, install it with the official no-clone GitHub
installer; if it is already installed, reuse it. Bootstrap or connect this
project, then generate the thin heartbeat prompt and set the current Codex CLI
goal to `/goal <thin task_body>`. Show me the current goal, concrete user gate
if any, top todos, and next safe action before longer work. Keep me in this TUI
and do not use hidden headless execution.
```

That one message is the install, connect, status check, and loop activation.
The first useful TUI response should show the current goal, any concrete user
gate, top todos, and next safe action. Hidden `codex exec` is not the default
bootstrap path. Details for generated messages, later same-TUI automation, and
proof capture live in [Getting Started](docs/guides/getting-started.md).

A successful connection looks like this:

- `loopx doctor` passes;
- the project has `.loopx/registry.json`;
- the project has `.codex/goals/<goal-id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`;
- `loopx status` shows who should act next;
- local runtime state is ignored, not committed.

### Other Agents And Manual Shell

For Claude Code, Cursor, another terminal agent, or a manual shell, use the
same no-clone installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huangruiteng/loopx/main/scripts/install-from-github.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
loopx doctor
```

Then ask the agent to connect or run the command yourself:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
loopx bootstrap \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --objective "Improve this project through bounded, verified goal segments." \
  --goal-doc GOAL.md
```

Clone-based install is only for contributors who want the live canary wrapper:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx ~/loopx
~/loopx/scripts/install-local.sh
loopx doctor
```

For the full install, diagnose, connect, heartbeat, dashboard, development, and
command-reference workflow, read
[docs/guides/getting-started.md](docs/guides/getting-started.md).

## Community & Feedback

LoopX is still early. The most useful feedback comes from real
long-running agent projects: where the control plane helped, where it felt
heavy, and which user gates or handoffs still disappeared from view.

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/issues) for
  reproducible bugs, install problems, and feature requests.
- Open PRs for docs fixes, showcase writeups, and small public-safe examples.
- For Chinese-speaking early users, scan the Lark group first for fast
  onboarding help, feedback loops, and showcase co-creation. A WeChat group QR
  is available as a backup, but QR codes may expire; if one is stale, use Lark
  or open an issue to ask for a refresh.

## Core Workflows

After a project is connected, the daily loop is intentionally small:

```bash
loopx status
loopx history --goal-id your-project-goal
loopx quota should-run --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Users should not need to diagnose LoopX by hand. Ask your agent to run
the diagnostic packet and reason from it:

```text
Diagnose LoopX for this project end to end. Do not ask me to run shell
commands. Run loopx diagnose, tell me whether the project can
self-drive, what blocks it, the exact user/controller question if one exists,
and what you will do next.
```

Common operator actions:

```bash
loopx todo add --goal-id your-project-goal --role agent --text "Run the next bounded validation slice."
loopx review-packet --goal-id your-project-goal
loopx refresh-state --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Automatic turns should check quota before work and spend exactly once after
validated writeback:

```bash
loopx quota should-run --goal-id your-project-goal
loopx heartbeat-prompt --thin --goal-id your-project-goal
loopx quota spend-slot --goal-id your-project-goal --slots 1 --source heartbeat --execute
```

The `next_automatic_turn` reported by `quota plan` is only an advisory
scheduling hint: it chooses the highest-compute eligible goal. operator-gated, focus-waiting, waiting, throttled, paused, and health-blocked goals stay out of the eligible lane. When a control-plane repair is explicitly enabled,
`control_plane.self_repair.enabled=true` lets `quota should-run` return a
bounded `decision=self_repair` contract instead of normal delivery; missing
policy defaults off.

If quota returns a `gate_prompt` or `operator_question`, the target heartbeat
should proactively ask that concrete user/controller gate. If open user todos
are projected, do not call the turn "no new user action" while they remain open;
even during safe bypass, its report still has to list existing open user todos.
When `notify_user_on_open_todo=true`, skip delivery work and quota spend for
that blocker-push turn. With `safe_bypass_allowed=true`, the heartbeat may
still do one bounded read-only steering or analysis step. See
`docs/quota-allocation.md` for the full allocation contract.

After an automatic turn actually spends delivery compute, append one spend
event. Do not append spend for quiet `should_run=false` skips, preflight
failures, or pure dry-run previews.

The dashboard is optional and local:

```bash
loopx serve-status --global-registry --port 8766 --limit 80
cd ~/loopx/apps/dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
```

Before publishing docs or examples, keep the public/private boundary explicit:

```bash
loopx check \
  --scan-path README.md \
  --scan-path docs/ \
  --scan-path examples/
```

[Quota Allocation](docs/quota-allocation.md), and
[Public/Private Boundary](docs/public-private-boundary.md).

## Product Vision

LoopX starts with AI coding, research, and benchmark loops because those
workflows make state drift easy to see. The broader product direction is a
dynamic goal control plane for any long-running agent work where humans need
clear progress, gates, feedback, and recovery without reading raw logs.

One medium-term productization case is a creator-operator workflow: a
non-engineering user asks an agent to track social-platform trends, map them to
personal creative preferences, extract insights, draft content, and maintain a
material library. The bottleneck is not only model capability. The product has
to translate agent work into a friendly first screen: what happened, what is
happening, where it is blocked, what comes next, and how user feedback changes
the plan.

See [Product Vision](docs/product/vision.md) for the planned creator-operator
case, non-technical status model, fake-data demo path, and feedback/boundary
contract.

LoopX keeps local active goal state separate from the public repository:
do not commit `.loopx/`, `.codex/goals/`, live
`ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`, raw benchmark traces, or private operator artifacts.

Before publishing docs or examples, run:

```bash
loopx check \
  --scan-path README.md \
  --scan-path docs/ \
  --scan-path examples/
```

## Current Status

LoopX is early. It is not a full agent platform and not an autonomous
production controller.

The current milestone is a useful local substrate for goal state, run history,
operator gates, human reward, structured todos, quota-aware heartbeats,
read-only project maps, benchmark control-plane evidence, and a small
multi-project dashboard.

The next milestones are stronger project adapters, safer controller/sub-agent
coordination, better benchmark-runner ergonomics, a more polished operator
view, and creator/operator showcases that make the same control-plane value
legible beyond software engineering.
