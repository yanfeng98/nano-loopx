# Goal Harness

**Always-on agent teams, governed by human judgment.**

**Gate-aware human-in-the-loop control plane**

**Dynamic goal control plane for long-running agents**

**让多个 agent 昼夜接力，把人的判断留在控制面。**

Goal Harness 把目标、用户决策、agent todo、认领关系、scope、safe fallback、
run history 和 quota 放进同一层状态：该等人的地方明确等人，不该空等的
安全侧路继续推进。

Goal Harness is a local control plane for long-running AI agent projects. It
turns a static agent goal into a dynamic, reviewable state layer: goals, gates,
todos, claims, scopes, run history, quota, evidence, and human decisions stay
visible across many turns, so primary and side agents can keep working on safe
lanes while gated work waits for the person.

> Your agents keep the night shift. You keep the judgment.

## What Is It?

Goal Harness does not replace Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another agent
runtime. It sits above them and gives humans and agents a shared state layer for
long-running work.

Short answer: Goal Harness is not replacing Codex goal mode. Codex goal,
Codex App automation, and CLI scripts can trigger executor loops; Goal Harness
preserves the dynamic goal state those loops need to keep working across
turns.

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Codex / Claude Code / Cursor | Execute an agent loop: read, write, run commands, and respond. |
| Codex goal / automation / CLI scripts | Trigger or schedule the next executor loop. |
| Goal Harness | Preserve the dynamic goal state: gates, todos, run history, quota, evidence, boundaries, and handoff state. |

The product promise is not "more todo lists." It is a better
human-in-the-loop control surface: keep human judgment at high-value decision
points, keep safe fallback work moving when one lane is gated, and stop compute
spend when a turn cannot produce a verified transition.

Put differently: Goal Harness lets a user's agent team keep working across
tools, turns, and off-hours without losing the goal boundary. The technical
contract underneath that promise is explicit: agent identity, todo ownership,
scope, capability gates, quota, evidence writeback, and public/private
boundaries stay visible to the next turn.

## Why It Matters

Short agent tasks usually fail because the model makes a bad local choice.
Long-running agent work fails differently: state drifts.

After several runs, several projects, or several handoffs, the hard questions
become:

- What is the current objective, and what is explicitly out of scope?
- Which owner decision, source document, run artifact, or benchmark result is
  the current authority?
- What did the last agent run actually do, and how was it validated?
- Which next action belongs to the human, and which belongs to the agent?
- Which actions are safe read-only work, and which cross write, production,
  private-data, or publication boundaries?
- How does human feedback survive into the next run?

Goal Harness makes those questions machine-readable enough for agents and
legible enough for operators.

## What You Get

- **Lifetime goals**: durable project intentions that outlive one chat thread,
  run, todo, or implementation plan. A lifetime goal does not grant open-ended
  autonomy: only the next bounded transition is executable.
- **User gates**: concrete human decisions that stay visible instead of
  disappearing into chat.
- **Safe fallback**: audited side paths that can continue when one lane is
  gated, without bypassing the gate.
- **Todo ownership**: user and agent todos with `claimed_by` for multi-agent
  coordination.
- **Quota and steering**: a guard that says whether an automatic turn should
  run, wait, ask the user, self-repair, or stay quiet.
- **Run history and evidence**: compact append-only events for progress,
  validation, blockers, reward, benchmark results, and quota spend.
- **Public/private boundary checks**: local scans and docs rules to keep raw
  private state, credentials, logs, traces, and benchmark material out of
  public artifacts.

## Good Fits

Use Goal Harness when agent work spans time, people, projects, or safety
boundaries:

- multi-day or multi-week engineering and research goals;
- recurring heartbeat or monitor-style agent turns;
- benchmark and experiment loops that must wait for evidence;
- projects with owner/SOP gates or human reward judgments;
- controller agents that spawn scoped side agents;
- creator, research, or operations workflows where non-engineering users need
  agent progress translated into clear state, blockers, and feedback prompts;
- public/private boundary checks before publishing artifacts;
- local dashboards that should foreground user decisions before raw logs.

Do not use Goal Harness as an autonomous production controller. It is a local
coordination substrate; project ownership and dangerous permissions stay with
the human/operator.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Python 3.11+, `curl`, `tar`, macOS or Linux shell. Git is only
needed for contributor clone/canary workflows. The Python package has no
runtime dependencies outside the standard library.

The recommended start is agent-first. For Codex CLI users, stay in the TUI and
paste one message:

1. Open Codex CLI from your project repo.
2. Paste this message:

   ```text
   Start Goal Harness for this repo. If `goal-harness` is missing, install it
   with the official no-clone GitHub installer, then connect this project. Show
   me the current goal, concrete user gate if any, top todos, and next safe
   action before running longer work. Keep me in this Codex CLI TUI unless I
   explicitly accept a headless fallback.
   ```

   The agent should install or repair Goal Harness, connect the repo, run the
   quota/status guard, then show the current goal, user gate, top todos, and
   next safe action before longer work.

3. After Goal Harness is installed, generate a tailored one-message bootstrap
   when you want the stricter reusable prompt:

   ```bash
   goal-harness codex-cli-bootstrap-message --project . --goal-id <goal-id>
   ```

This is the primary Codex CLI path: the user keeps the visible TUI for steering,
review, and takeover; Goal Harness supplies goal state, todo ownership, quota,
gates, writeback, and the next safe action. Headless `codex exec` is an explicit
fallback, not the default experience. Local driver and visible-session proof
commands are follow-up automation checks, not first-run requirements.

For contributors validating the full Codex CLI path without running Codex, use:

```bash
goal-harness codex-cli-one-message-loop-pilot --project . --goal-id <goal-id> --agent-id <agent-id>
```

It packages the first visible TUI message and the later scheduler/executor
bridge into one dry-run packet.

For Codex App, Claude Code, Cursor, or another terminal agent, paste this from
the project repo:

```text
Install and connect Goal Harness for this project end to end. Do not stop at a
plan.

If `goal-harness` is not on PATH, install it without making me clone the repo:

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness/main/scripts/install-from-github.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

Then:
1. Run `goal-harness doctor`.
2. Choose a stable goal id from this repo name unless I gave one explicitly.
3. Read the project goal doc if present (`GOAL.md`, `README.md`, or the doc I
   name); otherwise ask me for a one-sentence objective.
4. Run `goal-harness connect` or `goal-harness bootstrap` for this repo with
   that goal id, objective, domain, and goal doc.
5. Explain the onboarding todo candidates and ask which ones I accept, edit,
   or reject.
6. Ensure `.goal-harness/` and `.codex/goals/` are ignored in this project.
7. Run `goal-harness registry`, `goal-harness status`, and
   `goal-harness check --scan-root .`.
8. Report the goal id, created files, current user todo, current agent todo,
   and next safe action.

Do not commit `.goal-harness/`, `.codex/goals/`, live ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE files,
runtime registries, raw logs, credentials, or private local paths.
```

Success looks like this:

- `goal-harness doctor` passes;
- the project has `.goal-harness/registry.json`;
- the project has `.codex/goals/<goal-id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`;
- `goal-harness status` shows who should act next;
- local runtime state is ignored, not committed.

Manual no-clone install is still available when you want to drive the setup
yourself:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness/main/scripts/install-from-github.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
goal-harness doctor
```

Clone-based install is for contributors who want the live canary wrapper:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness ~/goal-harness
~/goal-harness/scripts/install-local.sh
goal-harness doctor
```

Then connect a project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
goal-harness bootstrap \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --objective "Improve this project through bounded, verified goal segments." \
  --goal-doc GOAL.md
```

command-reference workflow, read

## Community & Feedback

Goal Harness is still early. The most useful feedback comes from real
long-running agent projects: where the control plane helped, where it felt
heavy, and which user gates or handoffs still disappeared from view.

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness/issues) for
  reproducible bugs, install problems, and feature requests.
- Open PRs for docs fixes, showcase writeups, and small public-safe examples.
- For Chinese-speaking early users, scan the Lark group first for fast
  onboarding help, feedback loops, and showcase co-creation. A WeChat group QR
  is available as a backup, but QR codes may expire; if one is stale, use Lark
  or open an issue to ask for a refresh.

## Core Workflows

After a project is connected, the daily loop is intentionally small:

```bash
goal-harness status
goal-harness history --goal-id your-project-goal
goal-harness quota should-run --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Users should not need to diagnose Goal Harness by hand. Ask your agent to run
the diagnostic packet and reason from it:

```text
Diagnose Goal Harness for this project end to end. Do not ask me to run shell
commands. Run goal-harness diagnose, tell me whether the project can
self-drive, what blocks it, the exact user/controller question if one exists,
and what you will do next.
```

Common operator actions:

```bash
goal-harness todo add --goal-id your-project-goal --role agent --text "Run the next bounded validation slice."
goal-harness review-packet --goal-id your-project-goal
goal-harness refresh-state --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Automatic turns should check quota before work and spend exactly once after
validated writeback:

```bash
goal-harness quota should-run --goal-id your-project-goal
goal-harness heartbeat-prompt --thin --goal-id your-project-goal
goal-harness quota spend-slot --goal-id your-project-goal --slots 1 --source heartbeat --execute
```

The dashboard is optional and local:

```bash
goal-harness serve-status --global-registry --port 8766 --limit 80
cd ~/goal-harness/apps/dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
```

Before publishing docs or examples, keep the public/private boundary explicit:

```bash
goal-harness check \
  --scan-path README.md \
  --scan-path docs/ \
  --scan-path examples/
```

## Product Vision

Goal Harness starts with AI coding, research, and benchmark loops because those
workflows make state drift easy to see. The broader product direction is a
dynamic goal control plane for any long-running agent work where humans need
clear progress, gates, feedback, and recovery without reading raw logs.

One medium-term productization case is a creator-operator workflow: a
non-engineering user asks an agent to track social-platform trends, map them to
personal creative preferences, extract insights, draft content, and maintain a
material library. The bottleneck is not only model capability. The product has
to translate agent work into a friendly first screen: what happened, what is
happening, where it is blocked, what comes next, and how user feedback changes
the plan.

See [Product Vision](docs/product/vision.md) for the planned creator-operator
case, non-technical status model, fake-data demo path, and feedback/boundary
contract.

## Contributing

External contributors should start with
[CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md](CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md) for public, claimable work and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, validation, and boundary rules.

Goal Harness keeps local active goal state separate from the public repository:
do not commit `.goal-harness/`, `.codex/goals/`, live
`ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`, raw benchmark traces, or private operator artifacts.

Before publishing docs or examples, run:

```bash
goal-harness check \
  --scan-path README.md \
  --scan-path docs/ \
  --scan-path examples/
```

## Current Status

Goal Harness is early. It is not a full agent platform and not an autonomous
production controller.

The current milestone is a useful local substrate for goal state, run history,
operator gates, human reward, structured todos, quota-aware heartbeats,
read-only project maps, benchmark control-plane evidence, and a small
multi-project dashboard.

The next milestones are stronger project adapters, safer controller/sub-agent
coordination, better benchmark-runner ergonomics, a more polished operator
view, and creator/operator showcases that make the same control-plane value
legible beyond software engineering.
