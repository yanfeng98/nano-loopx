# Goal Harness

**Long-running agent work, without losing the plot.**

**Gate-aware human-in-the-loop control plane**

**让人的判断成为控制面，而不是让 agent 在等待里空转。**

Goal Harness 把用户决策、agent todo、safe fallback、run history 和 quota
放进同一层状态：该停的地方明确停，该继续的安全侧路继续走。

Goal Harness is a local control plane for AI agent projects. It keeps goals,
gates, todos, run history, quota, side-agent ownership, and human decisions
visible across many turns.

> Long-running agent work should be recoverable, reviewable, handoffable, and
> safe by default.

## What Is It?

Goal Harness does not replace Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another agent
runtime. It sits above them and gives humans and agents a shared state layer for
long-running work.

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Codex / Claude Code / Cursor | Execute an agent loop: read, write, run commands, and respond. |
| Goal / automation / external scripts | Trigger or schedule the next agent loop. |
| Goal Harness | Preserve the lifetime goal: gates, todos, run history, quota, evidence, boundaries, and handoff state. |

The product promise is not "more todo lists." It is a better
human-in-the-loop control surface: keep human judgment at high-value decision
points, keep safe fallback work moving when one lane is gated, and stop compute
spend when a turn cannot produce a verified transition.

## See It In Action

| Case | What It Shows | Public Surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Blocked P0 with safe P1/P2 rotation](docs/showcases/cases/0617-blocked-p0-safe-rotation.md) | A user-gated high-priority lane stays visible while safe fallback work continues. | Reproducible synthetic demo |
| [Goal Harness self-iteration loop](docs/showcases/cases/0619-goal-harness-self-iteration.md) | A side agent improved Goal Harness itself while the primary agent stayed focused on benchmark work. | Commit-backed public evidence case |
| [Dynamic workflow for hardware-agent development](docs/showcases/cases/0619-dynamic-workflow-hardware-agent.md) | A fuzzy multi-agent engineering workflow can converge through one shared control plane. | Redacted public-safe stub |

The full [showcase catalog](docs/showcases/README.md) keeps each case
public-safe, reproducible where possible, and ready for future frontend
surfaces.

## Why It Matters

Short agent tasks usually fail because the model makes a bad local choice.
Long-running agent work fails differently: state drifts.

After several runs, several projects, or several handoffs, the hard questions
become:

- What is the current objective, and what is explicitly out of scope?
- Which owner decision, source document, run artifact, or benchmark result is
  the current authority?
- What did the last agent run actually do, and how was it validated?
- Which next action belongs to the human, and which belongs to the agent?
- Which actions are safe read-only work, and which cross write, production,
  private-data, or publication boundaries?
- How does human feedback survive into the next run?

Goal Harness makes those questions machine-readable enough for agents and
legible enough for operators.

## What You Get

- **Lifetime goals**: durable project intentions that outlive one chat thread,
  run, todo, or implementation plan. A lifetime goal does not grant open-ended
  autonomy: only the next bounded transition is executable.
- **User gates**: concrete human decisions that stay visible instead of
  disappearing into chat.
- **Safe fallback**: audited side paths that can continue when one lane is
  gated, without bypassing the gate.
- **Todo ownership**: user and agent todos with `claimed_by` for multi-agent
  coordination.
- **Quota and steering**: a guard that says whether an automatic turn should
  run, wait, ask the user, self-repair, or stay quiet.
- **Run history and evidence**: compact append-only events for progress,
  validation, blockers, reward, benchmark results, and quota spend.
- **Public/private boundary checks**: local scans and docs rules to keep raw
  private state, credentials, logs, traces, and benchmark material out of
  public artifacts.

## Good Fits

Use Goal Harness when agent work spans time, people, projects, or safety
boundaries:

- multi-day or multi-week engineering and research goals;
- recurring heartbeat or monitor-style agent turns;
- benchmark and experiment loops that must wait for evidence;
- projects with owner/SOP gates or human reward judgments;
- controller agents that spawn scoped side agents;
- creator, research, or operations workflows where non-engineering users need
  agent progress translated into clear state, blockers, and feedback prompts;
- public/private boundary checks before publishing artifacts;
- local dashboards that should foreground user decisions before raw logs.

Do not use Goal Harness as an autonomous production controller. It is a local
coordination substrate; project ownership and dangerous permissions stay with
the human/operator.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Python 3.11+, Git, macOS or Linux shell. The Python package has
no runtime dependencies outside the standard library.

The recommended start is agent-first. Paste this into Codex, Claude Code,
Cursor, or another terminal agent from the project repo:

```text
Install and connect Goal Harness for this project end to end. Do not stop at a
plan.

If `goal-harness` is not on PATH:
- clone https://github.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness to ~/goal-harness if it is
  not already present;
- run ~/goal-harness/scripts/install-local.sh;
- export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH".

Then:
1. Run `goal-harness doctor`.
2. Choose a stable goal id from this repo name unless I gave one explicitly.
3. Read the project goal doc if present (`GOAL.md`, `README.md`, or the doc I
   name); otherwise ask me for a one-sentence objective.
4. Run `goal-harness connect` or `goal-harness bootstrap` for this repo with
   that goal id, objective, domain, and goal doc.
5. Explain the onboarding todo candidates and ask which ones I accept, edit,
   or reject.
6. Ensure `.goal-harness/` and `.codex/goals/` are ignored in this project.
7. Run `goal-harness registry`, `goal-harness status`, and
   `goal-harness check --scan-root .`.
8. Report the goal id, created files, current user todo, current agent todo,
   and next safe action.

Do not commit `.goal-harness/`, `.codex/goals/`, live ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE files,
runtime registries, raw logs, credentials, or private local paths.
```

Success looks like this:

- `goal-harness doctor` passes;
- the project has `.goal-harness/registry.json`;
- the project has `.codex/goals/<goal-id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`;
- `goal-harness status` shows who should act next;
- local runtime state is ignored, not committed.

Manual install is still available when you want to drive the setup yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness ~/goal-harness
~/goal-harness/scripts/install-local.sh
goal-harness doctor
```

Then connect a project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
goal-harness bootstrap \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --objective "Improve this project through bounded, verified goal segments." \
  --goal-doc GOAL.md
```

For the full install, diagnose, connect, heartbeat, dashboard, development, and
command-reference workflow, read
[docs/guides/getting-started.md](docs/guides/getting-started.md).

## Core Workflows

After a project is connected, the daily loop is intentionally small:

```bash
goal-harness status
goal-harness history --goal-id your-project-goal
goal-harness quota should-run --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Users should not need to diagnose Goal Harness by hand. Ask your agent to run
the diagnostic packet and reason from it:

```text
Diagnose Goal Harness for this project end to end. Do not ask me to run shell
commands. Run goal-harness diagnose, tell me whether the project can
self-drive, what blocks it, the exact user/controller question if one exists,
and what you will do next.
```

Common operator actions:

```bash
goal-harness todo add --goal-id your-project-goal --role agent --text "Run the next bounded validation slice."
goal-harness review-packet --goal-id your-project-goal
goal-harness refresh-state --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Automatic turns should check quota before work and spend exactly once after
validated writeback:

```bash
goal-harness quota should-run --goal-id your-project-goal
goal-harness heartbeat-prompt --thin --goal-id your-project-goal
goal-harness quota spend-slot --goal-id your-project-goal --slots 1 --source heartbeat --execute
```

The dashboard is optional and local:

```bash
goal-harness serve-status --global-registry --port 8766 --limit 80
cd ~/goal-harness/apps/dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
```

Before publishing docs or examples, keep the public/private boundary explicit:

```bash
goal-harness check \
  --scan-path README.md \
  --scan-path docs/ \
  --scan-path examples/
```

contracts live in [Status Data](docs/status-data-contract.md),
[Quota Allocation](docs/quota-allocation.md), and
[Public/Private Boundary](docs/public-private-boundary.md).

## Boundary Snapshot

Safe to publish: registry schema, runtime layout, adapter lifecycle, generic
control-plane contracts, sanitized examples, smoke fixtures, and generic
validation commands.

Keep private: real local paths, task ids, internal document links, production
logs, raw experiment metrics, credentials, auth material, user-specific active
goal state, local registries, raw agent sessions, and benchmark traces.

## Product Vision

Goal Harness starts with AI coding, research, and benchmark loops because those
workflows make state drift easy to see. The broader product direction is a
lifetime-goal control plane for any long-running agent work where humans need
clear progress, gates, feedback, and recovery without reading raw logs.

One medium-term productization case is a creator-operator workflow: a
non-engineering user asks an agent to track social-platform trends, map them to
personal creative preferences, extract insights, draft content, and maintain a
material library. The bottleneck is not only model capability. The product has
to translate agent work into a friendly first screen: what happened, what is
happening, where it is blocked, what comes next, and how user feedback changes
the plan.

See [Product Vision](docs/product/vision.md) for the planned creator-operator
case, non-technical status model, fake-data demo path, and feedback/boundary
contract.

Goal Harness keeps local active goal state separate from the public repository:
do not commit `.goal-harness/`, `.codex/goals/`, live
`ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`, raw benchmark traces, or private operator artifacts.

Before publishing docs or examples, run:

```bash
goal-harness check \
  --scan-path README.md \
  --scan-path docs/ \
  --scan-path examples/
```

## Current Status

Goal Harness is early. It is not a full agent platform and not an autonomous
production controller.

The current milestone is a useful local substrate for goal state, run history,
operator gates, human reward, structured todos, quota-aware heartbeats,
read-only project maps, benchmark control-plane evidence, and a small
multi-project dashboard.

The next milestones are stronger project adapters, safer controller/sub-agent
coordination, better benchmark-runner ergonomics, a more polished operator
view, and creator/operator showcases that make the same control-plane value
legible beyond software engineering.
