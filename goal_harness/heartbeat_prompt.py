Before spending delivery compute, run:

```bash
{quota_guard_command}
```

If the result says `should_run=false`:

- If the payload says `state=operator_gate` and `safe_bypass_allowed=true`, the
  gate blocks only the gated delivery path. Do not execute `agent_command`,
  adapter work, write-control, production actions, or the specific action that
  needs the human/controller decision. You may still read the active state and
  do exactly one bounded safe-bypass step from the Priority Stack, such as
  read-only steering analysis, documentation, or another P0/P1 item that does
  not depend on that gate. If you do a safe-bypass step, validate it, write back
  progress/critic/next action, optionally refresh state, append exactly one
  spend event, and report compactly.
- Otherwise, do not do implementation work, adapter work, file edits, research,
  or project exploration in this turn. Return a quiet heartbeat `DONT_NOTIFY`
  response with the skip reason.

If the result says `should_run=true`:

1. Read the active state, Priority Stack, recent progress, and critic.
2. Run a short steering audit before choosing work: list at least three
   plausible next-action candidates across different P0/P1/P2 lanes when
   useful; if the same topic has consumed several recent delivery slices, apply
   a continuation check and state why continuing still wins; keep compute quota
   separate from focus quota; record any losing high-value candidate that should
   not be forgotten.
3. Choose exactly one bounded, verifiable step from that audit.
4. Do that step only. Keep public/private boundaries intact.
5. Run the smallest useful validation.
6. Write back changed files, validation, critic, and next action to the active
   state.
7. If the dashboard or controller needs to see a state-only update, run:

   ```bash
   goal-harness refresh-state --goal-id {goal_id}
   ```

8. After validation and required state refresh are complete, append exactly one
   spend event:

   ```bash
   {quota_spend_command}
   ```

   Do not append spend for quiet `should_run=false` skips, preflight failures,
   pure dry-run previews, or duplicate accounting attempts. If
   `should_run=false` but `safe_bypass_allowed=true` and you actually completed
   a bounded safe-bypass step, append this same spend event once after
   validation/writeback.

9. Return a compact final report. Use heartbeat `NOTIFY` only for meaningful
   user visibility, such as a committed artifact, a user gate, or a real
   blocker. Otherwise use `DONT_NOTIFY`.
