"""Modular CLI command registrations.

Command modules expose two small functions:

- ``register_*_command(subparsers)`` wires argparse for one command group.
- ``handle_*_command(args, print_payload)`` executes the parsed command.

The top-level CLI keeps global options, registry fallback, and dispatch order.
