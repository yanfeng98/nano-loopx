# Goal Harness Meta Goal

## Objective

Keep the public Goal Harness project healthy enough that another local Codex
thread can bootstrap a goal, inspect registry and run history, check public
boundary safety, and render a first-screen status queue without relying on any
private project context.

## Current Scope

- Keep `scripts/install-local.sh`, `goal-harness bootstrap`,
  `goal-harness check`, `goal-harness status`, `goal-harness archive-runtime`,
  and `goal-harness serve-status` runnable from a fresh clone.
- Keep docs and examples aligned with the current CLI surface.
- Keep public examples sanitized: no local user paths, private documents,
  credentials, raw logs, or internal task identifiers.
- Treat project-specific adapters as private until their contract is generic
  enough to document publicly.

## Next Action

- Use `docs/state-interaction-model.md` as the gate before adding more
  controller, reward, adapter, or dashboard features. The next implementation
  slice should make the Reward CLI Draft derive better defaults from the
  selected Operator Decision and missing gates, while keeping browser writes
  disabled by default.

## Recent Progress

- 2026-06-01T11:43:29+08:00: Added `docs/status-data-contract.md`,
  linked it from README / architecture / attention queue / integration docs,
  pushed the public commit, and saved a compact self-health run with
  `health_check=22/22`.
- 2026-06-01T11:48:36+08:00: Added
  `examples/render-status-dashboard.py`, documented the static dashboard demo,
  and validated that `examples/status.example.json` renders to a local HTML
  dashboard with user/controller, Codex-ready, and external-evidence lanes.
- 2026-06-01T11:59:59+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md`, reframed the single-file HTML
  renderer as a diagnostic fallback, and selected a React/Vite/shadcn/TanStack
  stack for the product dashboard after benchmarking observability and
  orchestration consoles.
- 2026-06-01T12:05:18+08:00: Scaffolded `apps/dashboard` as a Vite + React +
  TypeScript app that reads `examples/status.example.json`, validates it with
  Zod, renders status lanes, metrics, a Recharts queue chart, and a sortable
  TanStack Table behind URL-backed TanStack Router filters.
- 2026-06-01T12:15:37+08:00: Validated the dashboard scaffold with
  `npm --prefix apps/dashboard run build`, browser smoke checks for the
  `Goal Operations` screen, and a public contract scan over the repo. Updated
  the contract scanner to skip `node_modules` so the new npm app remains
  compatible with `--scan-root .`.
- 2026-06-01T12:21:11+08:00: Added dashboard status source controls. The app
  now keeps `examples/status.example.json` as a fallback, accepts a
  URL-backed status source through `statusUrl`, loads imported JSON files, and
  validates every loaded payload with the same Zod status data contract.
- 2026-06-01T12:28:37+08:00: Validated the status source path with a generated
  `apps/dashboard/public/status.local.json` export and a browser smoke check at
  `?statusUrl=/status.local.json`. Added dashboard docs plus a `.gitignore`
  guard so local status exports stay untracked.
- 2026-06-01T12:37:47+08:00: Added `goal-harness serve-status`, a loopback HTTP
  server for live dashboard status JSON with `/status.json`, `/healthz`,
  no-store responses, and local CORS headers. The React dashboard now has a
  default `Live` source path for `http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`.
- 2026-06-01T12:47:47+08:00: Added compact run-history to the public
  `goal-harness status` contract, stripping local artifact paths while exposing
  recent classifications, health check summaries, and JSON/Markdown artifact
  availability. The React dashboard now lets an operator select an attention
  queue row and inspect the corresponding run-history detail panel.
- 2026-06-01T13:00:03+08:00: Added `contract.checks` to the public status data
  contract, rendered contract health detail in the React dashboard and the
  static HTML fallback, refreshed the dashboard visual baseline toward a
  product control-plane UI, and recorded the next experiment-controller
  milestone in `docs/experiment-controller-milestone.md`.
- 2026-06-01T13:13:04+08:00: Added the first public experiment-controller
  contract slice: `goal-harness status` now whitelists compact `human_reward`
  fields, maps `needs_human_reward`, `inspect_result`, and
  `blocked_by_safety` classifications into the attention queue, and the React
  dashboard plus static HTML fallback show human reward signals in run history.
  Added sanitized experiment-controller run and reward examples.
- 2026-06-01T13:32:10+08:00: Added compact `controller_readiness` to the
  public status contract, React dashboard, and static HTML fallback. Run
  history can now show whether an experiment controller is ready for read-only
  observation, decision advice, or write control, plus the missing gate names
  and compact gate reviews. Updated sanitized examples and milestone docs.
- 2026-06-01T13:44:00+08:00: Added `goal-harness reward`, a generic operator
  feedback writer that appends compact `human_reward` overlays to a goal run
  index without rewriting private run payloads. Updated run-history loading to
  merge later overlay rows for the same run key, documented the command in
  README / integration / status contract / experiment-controller milestone,
  and added private-looking text rejection for reward summaries.
- 2026-06-01T14:45:00+08:00: Added the first multi-project dashboard
  navigation surface. `goal-harness status` now exposes public-safe goal
  `domain` in compact run history, the React dashboard renders a first-screen
  `Goal Directory` across all known goals, and the old queue mix chart was
  removed so attention lanes and run-history drill-down stay focused.
- 2026-06-01T15:00:00+08:00: Added a local-only `Reward CLI Draft` to the
  dashboard run-history panel. It is generated from the selected goal, latest
  compact run timestamp, registry, and runtime root; defaults to `--dry-run`;
  and keeps browser-side reward writes out of scope until the same safety checks
  are enforced locally.
- 2026-06-01T15:08:00+08:00: Added local reward dry-run validation for the
  dashboard. `goal-harness serve-status` now exposes `POST /reward/dry-run`,
  the React run-history panel can validate selected goal/run reward drafts
  against that loopback endpoint, and the response is compact with
  `appended=false` and no private artifact paths.
- 2026-06-01T15:18:00+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-reward-write-boundary.md` to define the future browser reward
  append gate. The design requires an explicit server write flag, loopback-only
  binding, a browser capability token, exact run targeting, a dry-run preview
  handshake, stale-preview rejection, compact responses, and validation that the
  index changes only on a reviewed append path.
- 2026-06-01T15:37:00+08:00: Added queue-level controller gate hints and a
  reusable new-project Codex handoff prompt. `goal-harness status` now lifts
  compact `controller_stage`, `missing_gates`, and `next_handoff_condition`
  into attention queue items so a multi-project operator can see why a watched
  goal is not ready without opening the run payload. The React dashboard,
  static HTML fallback, status contract, and sanitized examples render those
  gate hints. Added `docs/new-project-codex-prompt.md` and linked it from
  README and integration docs.
- 2026-06-01T15:47:30+08:00: Added `goal-harness new-project-prompt`, a CLI
  generator for the Chinese Codex handoff prompt used to connect a project from
  a project folder plus goal document. The generated command defaults to a
  read-only adapter and omits `--next-probe` unless a real read-only pre-tick
  command is provided.
- 2026-06-01T16:04:18+08:00: Added `scripts/install-local.sh` so a fresh local
  checkout can install `goal-harness` into `~/.local/bin` and add that directory
  to the shell profile; `scripts/goal-harness` now resolves symlink targets so
  the installed wrapper still finds the real repository root. Also added
  `connect --goal-doc` as a primary authority source in registry and initial
  state, and updated `new-project-prompt` to run a CLI preflight before project
  connection.
- 2026-06-01T16:12:12+08:00: Added `goal-harness doctor` to diagnose local CLI
  installation, PATH, symlink realpath, wrapper script, and Python import
  health. The installer and new-project handoff now call `goal-harness doctor`
  instead of `--help`, so future connection failures expose a structured fix
  rather than stopping at a missing command.
- 2026-06-01T16:22:59+08:00: Made actionable unregistered runtime goals visible
  in the public attention queue as `unregistered_runtime_goal`. This keeps
  multi-project dashboard status authoritative when a new project has saved run
  history before registry connection, while watch-only legacy records remain in
  run history without becoming queue work.
- 2026-06-01T16:32:48+08:00: Added `goal-harness archive-runtime` as the
  cleanup path for obsolete runtime-only goals. It defaults to dry-run, requires
  `--execute` before moving files, protects registry members by default, and
  moves reviewed runtime directories under `<runtime-root>/archived-goals/`.
- 2026-06-01T16:58:24+08:00: Added `goal-harness refresh-state`, a state-only
  run writer for the case where a controller updated active state, ledger, or
  planning docs without running a project adapter. `status` now maps the compact
  `state_refreshed` classification to Codex-ready work, the new-project handoff
  prompt teaches receiving sessions to run the refresh when dashboard still
  shows an old run, and the latest zero-start project was connected into the
  local multi-project registry so it appears as `state_refreshed -> codex`
  instead of an unregistered runtime goal.
- 2026-06-01T17:07:01+08:00: Replaced the manual multi-project registry patch
  with automatic global-registry sync. `goal-harness connect` and
  `goal-harness refresh-state` now merge local project registry entries into
  `~/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json`; `status` falls back to that
  global registry when no project-local registry exists; and
  `goal-harness sync-global` exists for explicit diagnosis or recovery. The
  global registry strips raw authority-source details while keeping local paths
  private under the shared runtime root.
- 2026-06-01T17:16:09+08:00: Added the public
  `skills/goal-harness-project/SKILL.md` and taught `scripts/install-local.sh`
  to install or update it under `~/.codex/skills/goal-harness-project` by
  default. The skill captures the agent-side workflow for project connect,
  state refresh, global sync, validation, private boundary, and Chinese review
  reporting.
- 2026-06-01T17:36:10+08:00: Added global-registry health to the public status
  contract and React dashboard. `goal-harness status` now reports
  `global_registry` findings for stale source registries, missing active state
  files, duplicate goal ids, and local-vs-global scope mismatches. CS-Notes
  pre-tick now reads the global registry first-screen status, so a newly
  connected read-only project appears as `state_refreshed -> codex` instead of
  a local-registry ghost.
- 2026-06-01T17:55:00+08:00: Fixed `status` / `serve-status` default contract
  scan boundaries. Multi-project status can now be run from a private project
  checkout while still checking the public Goal Harness install root by
  default; operators must opt in with `--scan-root` or `--scan-path` before
  scanning a project-specific public surface.
- 2026-06-01T18:02:32+08:00: Improved state-only refresh action quality after
  inspecting a real zero-start project connection. The latest active state had
  a precise next action, but the compact dashboard run still showed the generic
  refresh notice. `refresh-state` now derives the compact `recommended_action`
  from the first public-safe `## Next Action` line, skips private-looking lines
  such as internal document URLs, and falls back to the generic refresh notice
  only when needed. The rendered refresh Markdown also normalizes bullet
  prefixes.
- 2026-06-01T18:24:00+08:00: Added `goal-harness read-only-map`, a generic
  read-only project-map run writer for connected projects. It accepts
  `read_only_project_map_v0` or compatible `*_read_only_map_v0` adapters,
  derives a public-safe dashboard action from active state, records compact map
  counts in run history, and keeps raw project evidence in the private runtime
  payload. Updated status classification, dashboard schema/rendering, docs,
  new-project prompt guidance, and installed skill workflow.
- 2026-06-01T18:36:00+08:00: Added
  `docs/state-interaction-model.md` to define the state boundary between the
  durable goal, Codex App executor, human operator, and dashboard. The document
  names actor ownership, state stores, state transitions, dashboard first-screen
  rules, invariants, and a feature-gate checklist so future work does not add
  isolated commands before the state contract is clear. Linked it from
  `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- 2026-06-01T18:51:00+08:00: Added lifecycle phases to the public status
  contract and dashboard. `goal-harness status` now derives compact
  `lifecycle_phase` / `lifecycle_flags` for attention items, run-history goals,
  and compact runs. The React dashboard validates those fields and renders a
  human-facing `User Review Map` so users see connected, mapped, refreshed,
  adapter-inspected, reward-judged, controller-gated, and controller-ready
  states separately from raw adapter classifications. The docs now clarify that
  CLI status is agent-facing machine state, while the dashboard is the
  operator-facing interpretation layer.
- 2026-06-01T18:58:00+08:00: Added a selected-goal `Operator Decision` panel
  to the React dashboard. The panel derives a human stance from queue item,
  lifecycle phase, readiness gates, and recommended action: review or authorize,
  let Codex continue, wait for evidence, or fix health first. This keeps
  `goal-harness status` as an agent-facing contract while making the dashboard
  answer the user question before showing run-history details.
- 2026-06-01T19:12:00+08:00: Connected `Operator Decision` to a selected-goal
  `Safe CLI Path`. The dashboard now shows the safe local command class for the
  current stance: status/history inspection, `read-only-map --dry-run`,
  `refresh-state --dry-run`, or a reward-gate handoff to the existing Reward CLI
  Draft. The bridge is explicitly read/dry-run oriented and does not add
  browser-side reward append or approval writes.

  and verify the latest zero-start project row shows `state_refreshed`, Codex,
  and the refreshed-state action
- Synthetic project: `connect` auto-synced `auto-sync-demo` into a temp
  `registry.global.json`; `refresh-state` re-synced it; and `status` from a
  directory without `.goal-harness/registry.json` fell back to that global
  registry and showed `state_refreshed -> codex`
- Real sync: merged a private local registry and the latest zero-start project
  registry into the shared local global registry
- Default global status: `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --runtime-root
  <runtime-root> --format json status --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs`

  synthetic runtime directory under `<runtime-root>/archived-goals/`
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id registered-goal` rejects a synthetic
  registry member unless `--allow-registered` is explicitly supplied
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id zero-start-project-goal` dry-runs a
  current unregistered runtime goal cleanup without moving files
- `goal-harness connect --goal-doc docs/GOAL.md` records
  `authority_sources[0].path == "docs/GOAL.md"` in the registry and renders
  `Primary goal document: docs/GOAL.md` in the initial state
- `goal-harness registry` renders `authorities=1` for a goal connected with a
  primary goal document
- Browser smoke: load the dashboard with `/status.local.json`, select

  status contract, and experiment-controller milestone docs
- `goal-harness --registry ~/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json --format
  json status` run from a private project directory returns `ok=true`,
  `contract.summary.errors=0`, and `global_registry.summary.findings=0`
- Synthetic refresh dry-runs prove a public `## Next Action` line becomes the
  compact `recommended_action`, while an internal-document URL line is skipped
  in favor of the next public-safe action
- Real premium refresh at `2026-06-01T18:01:37+08:00` now shows the concrete
  GZXMT evidence-template action in global status and dashboard local JSON

## Guards

- Do not copy private registry entries, project paths, document links, task ids,
  credentials, or raw run payloads into public examples.
- Keep runtime data local; commit only sanitized docs, source, and examples.
- Prefer small, verified public-facing changes over broad rewrites.
