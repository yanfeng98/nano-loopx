# Goal Harness Meta Goal

## Objective

Keep the public Goal Harness project healthy enough that another local Codex
thread can bootstrap a goal, inspect registry and run history, check public
boundary safety, and render a first-screen status queue without relying on any
private project context.

## Current Scope

- Keep `scripts/install-local.sh`, `goal-harness bootstrap`,
  `goal-harness check`, `goal-harness status`, `goal-harness archive-runtime`,
  and `goal-harness serve-status` runnable from a fresh clone.
- Keep docs and examples aligned with the current CLI surface.
- Keep public examples sanitized: no local user paths, private documents,
  credentials, raw logs, or internal task identifiers.
- Treat project-specific adapters as private until their contract is generic
  enough to document publicly.

## Next Action

- Use `docs/state-interaction-model.md` as the gate before adding more
  controller, reward, adapter, or dashboard features. The next implementation
  slice should make operator reward submission explicit: when a user gives a
  Chinese reward judgment, Codex should record the durable signal as an exact
  run-bound `human_reward` overlay through `goal-harness reward`, then write a
  short active-state summary and optionally forward the same Review Packet to
  the target project agent for immediate execution.

## Recent Progress

- 2026-06-01T22:12:40+08:00: Collapsed the dashboard's first-screen share
  affordances from several copy buttons into one canonical `Copy Review Packet`.
  The selected packet now follows the selected action card, so three active
  actions can share one copy panel without ambiguity: clicking another card
  changes the packet target and shows a `Selected` badge. The packet combines
  the review link, Chinese user judgment template, project-agent instructions,
  reward/default hint, and a local dry-run preview. Reward previews target an
  exact run-bound `human_reward` overlay via `goal-harness reward --dry-run`;
  controller previews target `read-only-map --dry-run` or the selected safe
  path. README, status data contract, and state interaction docs now state that
  durable reward belongs in the run-bound `human_reward` overlay, while active
  state only summarizes recorded reward and Review Packet is only for
  user-to-agent coordination.
- 2026-06-01T11:43:29+08:00: Added `docs/status-data-contract.md`,
  linked it from README / architecture / attention queue / integration docs,
  pushed the public commit, and saved a compact self-health run with
  `health_check=22/22`.
- 2026-06-01T11:48:36+08:00: Added
  `examples/render-status-dashboard.py`, documented the static dashboard demo,
  and validated that `examples/status.example.json` renders to a local HTML
  dashboard with user/controller, Codex-ready, and external-evidence lanes.
- 2026-06-01T11:59:59+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md`, reframed the single-file HTML
  renderer as a diagnostic fallback, and selected a React/Vite/shadcn/TanStack
  stack for the product dashboard after benchmarking observability and
  orchestration consoles.
- 2026-06-01T12:05:18+08:00: Scaffolded `apps/dashboard` as a Vite + React +
  TypeScript app that reads `examples/status.example.json`, validates it with
  Zod, renders status lanes, metrics, a Recharts queue chart, and a sortable
  TanStack Table behind URL-backed TanStack Router filters.
- 2026-06-01T12:15:37+08:00: Validated the dashboard scaffold with
  `npm --prefix apps/dashboard run build`, browser smoke checks for the
  `Goal Operations` screen, and a public contract scan over the repo. Updated
  the contract scanner to skip `node_modules` so the new npm app remains
  compatible with `--scan-root .`.
- 2026-06-01T12:21:11+08:00: Added dashboard status source controls. The app
  now keeps `examples/status.example.json` as a fallback, accepts a
  URL-backed status source through `statusUrl`, loads imported JSON files, and
  validates every loaded payload with the same Zod status data contract.
- 2026-06-01T12:28:37+08:00: Validated the status source path with a generated
  `apps/dashboard/public/status.local.json` export and a browser smoke check at
  `?statusUrl=/status.local.json`. Added dashboard docs plus a `.gitignore`
  guard so local status exports stay untracked.
- 2026-06-01T12:37:47+08:00: Added `goal-harness serve-status`, a loopback HTTP
  server for live dashboard status JSON with `/status.json`, `/healthz`,
  no-store responses, and local CORS headers. The React dashboard now has a
  default `Live` source path for `http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`.
- 2026-06-01T12:47:47+08:00: Added compact run-history to the public
  `goal-harness status` contract, stripping local artifact paths while exposing
  recent classifications, health check summaries, and JSON/Markdown artifact
  availability. The React dashboard now lets an operator select an attention
  queue row and inspect the corresponding run-history detail panel.
- 2026-06-01T13:00:03+08:00: Added `contract.checks` to the public status data
  contract, rendered contract health detail in the React dashboard and the
  static HTML fallback, refreshed the dashboard visual baseline toward a
  product control-plane UI, and recorded the next experiment-controller
  milestone in `docs/experiment-controller-milestone.md`.
- 2026-06-01T13:13:04+08:00: Added the first public experiment-controller
  contract slice: `goal-harness status` now whitelists compact `human_reward`
  fields, maps `needs_human_reward`, `inspect_result`, and
  `blocked_by_safety` classifications into the attention queue, and the React
  dashboard plus static HTML fallback show human reward signals in run history.
  Added sanitized experiment-controller run and reward examples.
- 2026-06-01T13:32:10+08:00: Added compact `controller_readiness` to the
  public status contract, React dashboard, and static HTML fallback. Run
  history can now show whether an experiment controller is ready for read-only
  observation, decision advice, or write control, plus the missing gate names
  and compact gate reviews. Updated sanitized examples and milestone docs.
- 2026-06-01T13:44:00+08:00: Added `goal-harness reward`, a generic operator
  feedback writer that appends compact `human_reward` overlays to a goal run
  index without rewriting private run payloads. Updated run-history loading to
  merge later overlay rows for the same run key, documented the command in
  README / integration / status contract / experiment-controller milestone,
  and added private-looking text rejection for reward summaries.
- 2026-06-01T14:45:00+08:00: Added the first multi-project dashboard
  navigation surface. `goal-harness status` now exposes public-safe goal
  `domain` in compact run history, the React dashboard renders a first-screen
  `Goal Directory` across all known goals, and the old queue mix chart was
  removed so attention lanes and run-history drill-down stay focused.
- 2026-06-01T15:00:00+08:00: Added a local-only `Reward CLI Draft` to the
  dashboard run-history panel. It is generated from the selected goal, latest
  compact run timestamp, registry, and runtime root; defaults to `--dry-run`;
  and keeps browser-side reward writes out of scope until the same safety checks
  are enforced locally.
- 2026-06-01T15:08:00+08:00: Added local reward dry-run validation for the
  dashboard. `goal-harness serve-status` now exposes `POST /reward/dry-run`,
  the React run-history panel can validate selected goal/run reward drafts
  against that loopback endpoint, and the response is compact with
  `appended=false` and no private artifact paths.
- 2026-06-01T15:18:00+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-reward-write-boundary.md` to define the future browser reward
  append gate. The design requires an explicit server write flag, loopback-only
  binding, a browser capability token, exact run targeting, a dry-run preview
  handshake, stale-preview rejection, compact responses, and validation that the
  index changes only on a reviewed append path.
- 2026-06-01T15:37:00+08:00: Added queue-level controller gate hints and a
  reusable new-project Codex handoff prompt. `goal-harness status` now lifts
  compact `controller_stage`, `missing_gates`, and `next_handoff_condition`
  into attention queue items so a multi-project operator can see why a watched
  goal is not ready without opening the run payload. The React dashboard,
  static HTML fallback, status contract, and sanitized examples render those
  gate hints. Added `docs/new-project-codex-prompt.md` and linked it from
  README and integration docs.
- 2026-06-01T15:47:30+08:00: Added `goal-harness new-project-prompt`, a CLI
  generator for the Chinese Codex handoff prompt used to connect a project from
  a project folder plus goal document. The generated command defaults to a
  read-only adapter and omits `--next-probe` unless a real read-only pre-tick
  command is provided.
- 2026-06-01T16:04:18+08:00: Added `scripts/install-local.sh` so a fresh local
  checkout can install `goal-harness` into `~/.local/bin` and add that directory
  to the shell profile; `scripts/goal-harness` now resolves symlink targets so
  the installed wrapper still finds the real repository root. Also added
  `connect --goal-doc` as a primary authority source in registry and initial
  state, and updated `new-project-prompt` to run a CLI preflight before project
  connection.
- 2026-06-01T16:12:12+08:00: Added `goal-harness doctor` to diagnose local CLI
  installation, PATH, symlink realpath, wrapper script, and Python import
  health. The installer and new-project handoff now call `goal-harness doctor`
  instead of `--help`, so future connection failures expose a structured fix
  rather than stopping at a missing command.
- 2026-06-01T16:22:59+08:00: Made actionable unregistered runtime goals visible
  in the public attention queue as `unregistered_runtime_goal`. This keeps
  multi-project dashboard status authoritative when a new project has saved run
  history before registry connection, while watch-only legacy records remain in
  run history without becoming queue work.
- 2026-06-01T16:32:48+08:00: Added `goal-harness archive-runtime` as the
  cleanup path for obsolete runtime-only goals. It defaults to dry-run, requires
  `--execute` before moving files, protects registry members by default, and
  moves reviewed runtime directories under `<runtime-root>/archived-goals/`.
- 2026-06-01T16:58:24+08:00: Added `goal-harness refresh-state`, a state-only
  run writer for the case where a controller updated active state, ledger, or
  planning docs without running a project adapter. `status` now maps the compact
  `state_refreshed` classification to Codex-ready work, the new-project handoff
  prompt teaches receiving sessions to run the refresh when dashboard still
  shows an old run, and the latest zero-start project was connected into the
  local multi-project registry so it appears as `state_refreshed -> codex`
  instead of an unregistered runtime goal.
- 2026-06-01T17:07:01+08:00: Replaced the manual multi-project registry patch
  with automatic global-registry sync. `goal-harness connect` and
  `goal-harness refresh-state` now merge local project registry entries into
  `~/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json`; `status` falls back to that
  global registry when no project-local registry exists; and
  `goal-harness sync-global` exists for explicit diagnosis or recovery. The
  global registry strips raw authority-source details while keeping local paths
  private under the shared runtime root.
- 2026-06-01T17:16:09+08:00: Added the public
  `skills/goal-harness-project/SKILL.md` and taught `scripts/install-local.sh`
  to install or update it under `~/.codex/skills/goal-harness-project` by
  default. The skill captures the agent-side workflow for project connect,
  state refresh, global sync, validation, private boundary, and Chinese review
  reporting.
- 2026-06-01T17:36:10+08:00: Added global-registry health to the public status
  contract and React dashboard. `goal-harness status` now reports
  `global_registry` findings for stale source registries, missing active state
  files, duplicate goal ids, and local-vs-global scope mismatches. CS-Notes
  pre-tick now reads the global registry first-screen status, so a newly
  connected read-only project appears as `state_refreshed -> codex` instead of
  a local-registry ghost.
- 2026-06-01T17:55:00+08:00: Fixed `status` / `serve-status` default contract
  scan boundaries. Multi-project status can now be run from a private project
  checkout while still checking the public Goal Harness install root by
  default; operators must opt in with `--scan-root` or `--scan-path` before
  scanning a project-specific public surface.
- 2026-06-01T18:02:32+08:00: Improved state-only refresh action quality after
  inspecting a real zero-start project connection. The latest active state had
  a precise next action, but the compact dashboard run still showed the generic
  refresh notice. `refresh-state` now derives the compact `recommended_action`
  from the first public-safe `## Next Action` line, skips private-looking lines
  such as internal document URLs, and falls back to the generic refresh notice
  only when needed. The rendered refresh Markdown also normalizes bullet
  prefixes.
- 2026-06-01T18:24:00+08:00: Added `goal-harness read-only-map`, a generic
  read-only project-map run writer for connected projects. It accepts
  `read_only_project_map_v0` or compatible `*_read_only_map_v0` adapters,
  derives a public-safe dashboard action from active state, records compact map
  counts in run history, and keeps raw project evidence in the private runtime
  payload. Updated status classification, dashboard schema/rendering, docs,
  new-project prompt guidance, and installed skill workflow.
- 2026-06-01T18:36:00+08:00: Added
  `docs/state-interaction-model.md` to define the state boundary between the
  durable goal, Codex App executor, human operator, and dashboard. The document
  names actor ownership, state stores, state transitions, dashboard first-screen
  rules, invariants, and a feature-gate checklist so future work does not add
  isolated commands before the state contract is clear. Linked it from
  `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- 2026-06-01T18:51:00+08:00: Added lifecycle phases to the public status
  contract and dashboard. `goal-harness status` now derives compact
  `lifecycle_phase` / `lifecycle_flags` for attention items, run-history goals,
  and compact runs. The React dashboard validates those fields and renders a
  human-facing `User Review Map` so users see connected, mapped, refreshed,
  adapter-inspected, reward-judged, controller-gated, and controller-ready
  states separately from raw adapter classifications. The docs now clarify that
  CLI status is agent-facing machine state, while the dashboard is the
  operator-facing interpretation layer.
- 2026-06-01T18:58:00+08:00: Added a selected-goal `Operator Decision` panel
  to the React dashboard. The panel derives a human stance from queue item,
  lifecycle phase, readiness gates, and recommended action: review or authorize,
  let Codex continue, wait for evidence, or fix health first. This keeps
  `goal-harness status` as an agent-facing contract while making the dashboard
  answer the user question before showing run-history details.
- 2026-06-01T19:08:36+08:00: Connected `Operator Decision` to a selected-goal
  `Safe CLI Path`. The dashboard now shows the safe local command class for the
  current stance: status/history inspection, `read-only-map --dry-run`,
  `refresh-state --dry-run`, or a reward-gate handoff to the existing Reward CLI
  Draft. The bridge is explicitly read/dry-run oriented and does not add
  browser-side reward append or approval writes.
- 2026-06-01T19:15:23+08:00: Made the dashboard `Reward CLI Draft` derive
  scenario-specific defaults from the selected `Operator Decision` and missing
  gates. Mapped Codex-ready goals default to `use_read_only_map` with a positive
  handoff reward; external-evidence goals missing `human_reward_capture` default
  to `record_human_reward_gate` with the compact handoff condition; controller
  opt-in goals show their gate label but still avoid a reward command when no
  compact run exists. The panel can reset to these defaults after user edits,
  and browser writes remain disabled.
- 2026-06-01T19:21:38+08:00: Promoted operator-derived actions into a
  first-screen `User Actions` summary. The React dashboard now derives compact
  action cards from the same `Operator Decision` and reward-default logic used
  by selected-goal detail, so reward gates, controller opt-ins, evidence
  watches, Codex handoffs, and blocking health items are visible before opening
  a goal. In the current global status, the first screen shows three cards:
  `Record human reward` for `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`, `Review controller
  opt-in` for `agent-harness-main-control`, and `Let Codex use the map` for the
  mapped Codex-ready project.
- 2026-06-01T19:30:27+08:00: Inlined the selected-detail action affordances
  into the first-screen `User Actions` cards. Each card now derives a safe path
  from the same `Safe CLI Path` builder and a compact reward hint from the same
  reward-draft defaults, so the first screen can show status/history,
  read-only-map dry-run, or reward-gate hints without turning the dashboard
  into a writer. README, status contract, and state-interaction docs now state
  that these first-screen hints are user-facing affordances over the
  agent-facing status export.
- 2026-06-01T19:37:04+08:00: Turned first-screen `User Actions` into a focused
  review flow by deriving a local action kind for each card: reward,
  controller, Codex, evidence, or health. The React dashboard now renders a
  compact segmented filter with per-kind counts, filters only the first-screen
  action cards, and keeps the raw status export unchanged. README, status
  contract, and state-interaction docs now clarify that action-kind focus is
  dashboard UI state over the agent-facing status contract.
- 2026-06-01T19:43:08+08:00: Made the `User Actions` action-kind focus
  URL-backed. The dashboard router now accepts `actionKind=all|reward|controller|codex|evidence|health`,
  and the first-screen action filter is driven by that search parameter instead
  of component-local state. Focused review views survive refresh and can be
  shared, including empty focused views such as `actionKind=evidence`, while
  remaining dashboard UI state only. README, status contract, and
  state-interaction docs now describe the URL-backed focus boundary.
- 2026-06-01T19:48:44+08:00: Made the selected goal detail URL-backed as
  `goalId`. All dashboard selection surfaces now update the same search
  parameter: `User Actions`, `Goal Directory`, attention lanes, attention table,
  and the run-history goal selector. If a loaded status source does not contain
  the requested goal, the dashboard falls back to the first available
  run-history goal and normalizes the URL. README, status contract, and
  state-interaction docs now describe selected-goal URL state as a browser
  review affordance, not part of the status export or durable goal truth.
- 2026-06-01T20:04:30+08:00: Added a compact first-screen `Review link`
  affordance to the React dashboard. It builds a canonical browser URL from the
  current `actionKind`, selected `goalId`, `statusUrl`, `lane`, and `severity`,
  displays those as review-state badges, and copies the link with a clipboard
  fallback for local HTTP previews. The control is labeled as UI state only and
  does not write reward, approval, controller opt-in, runtime indexes, or the
  status contract. README, status data contract, and state interaction docs now
  describe the copied link as a user review affordance over agent-facing
  status.
- 2026-06-01T20:12:51+08:00: Turned the copied review state into a first-screen
  operator handoff packet. The React dashboard now derives the selected action
  card from the current selected goal and action-kind lane, then builds a
  copyable packet with selected goal, action type, review link, Chinese review
  action, current judgment, context summary, `Reward/default hint`, and `Safe
  local path` including the command when available. The packet explicitly says
  it does not write reward, approval, controller opt-in, or write-control.
  README, status data contract, and state interaction docs now describe the
  packet as a user-facing project-agent handoff artifact, not a durable state
  transition.
- 2026-06-01T20:30:15+08:00: Moved user-required interaction to the dashboard
  first screen. `User Actions` and `Selected action share` now render before
  source controls, metrics, directory, maps, and raw queues; the share panel
  can copy a review link, operator handoff packet, or project-agent prompt.
  The selected share target now follows the current action filter rather than
  a stale run-history selection, so switching to `Reward` selects the reward
  card's goal. The project-agent prompt tells receiving Codex sessions to run
  `goal-harness doctor`, read the project registry, active state, and run
  history, follow only the safe local path, and report in Chinese.
- 2026-06-01T20:41:35+08:00: Added first-screen Chinese operator response
  templates to `Selected action share`. The React dashboard now derives a
  `Copy User Response` packet from the selected action card and review link,
  with reward cards prompting for "同意记录这次 human reward / 暂不同意", reason,
  and next step, and controller cards prompting for "同意继续
  read-only/controller opt-in / 暂不同意", reason, next step, and an explicit
  no-write-control boundary. Codex/evidence/health cards also get conservative
  copy-only templates. README, status data contract, and state interaction
  docs describe the template as browser UI state, not durable reward,
  approval, controller opt-in, or write-control.

## Validation

- `python3 -m py_compile goal_harness/*.py`
- `python3 -m py_compile goal_harness/status.py examples/render-status-dashboard.py`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --help`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json check --scan-root .`
- Parse all JSON examples in `examples/`.
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json status` includes
  `lifecycle_phase` and `lifecycle_flags` on attention items, run-history
  goals, and compact runs
- Browser DOM smoke: selected-goal detail shows `Operator Decision`; default
  mapped goal shows `Let Codex use the map`; `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`
  shows `Wait for evidence` plus missing gate copy; `agent-harness-main-control`
  shows `Review controller opt-in` and `Needs approval`
- Browser DOM smoke: selected-goal detail shows `Safe CLI Path`; default mapped
  goal shows a history handoff command; `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc` shows a
  watch/status command, reward gate, and handoff condition; `agent-harness-main-control`
  shows `read-only-map --dry-run` and an approval boundary.
- Browser DOM smoke: mapped goal reward draft defaults to
  `use_read_only_map` / `positive`; `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc` defaults to
  `record_human_reward_gate` / `neutral` with the compact handoff condition;
  `agent-harness-main-control` keeps `needs run` while showing the
  controller-opt-in default source.
- CLI dry-run smoke: `goal-harness reward --dry-run` accepts the derived tiger
  reward-gate fields and returns `ok=True`, `dry_run=True`, `appended=False`.
- Browser DOM smoke: first-screen `User Actions` appears before
  `Goal Directory`, shows `3 actions`, and includes reward gate, controller
  opt-in, and map handoff cards for the current global status.
- Browser DOM smoke: first-screen `User Actions` cards expose `Safe path` and
  `Reward draft`; the global status case shows a status watch command,
  `read-only-map --dry-run`, `goal-harness history`, and the reward decisions
  `record_human_reward_gate`, `controller opt-in / needs run`, and
  `use_read_only_map`.
- Browser DOM smoke: first-screen `User Actions` exposes action-kind filter
  buttons `All`, `Reward`, `Controller`, and `Codex`; clicking each focused
  filter reduces visible cards to the corresponding single action and preserves
  the safe path / reward draft hints.
- Browser DOM smoke: loading `?actionKind=controller` focuses the
  `User Actions` card list on controller work, keeps the URL stable after
  refresh, and clicking `Reward` updates the search parameter to
  `actionKind=reward` while preserving status URL state.
- Browser DOM smoke: loading
  `?actionKind=controller&goalId=agent-harness-main-control` opens the
  controller-focused action card and selected run-history detail; selecting the
  reward card updates `goalId=tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`, keeps
  `actionKind=reward`, and preserves `statusUrl`.
- Browser DOM smoke: the `Review link` panel is visible, shows `UI state only`,
  copies the current controller/agent-harness review URL into the clipboard,
  preserves `statusUrl`, `lane`, and `severity`, and updates when the operator
  switches to the reward filter and selects `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`.
- Browser DOM smoke: `Copy Handoff` copies a Chinese
  `Goal Harness Operator Handoff` packet for `agent-harness-main-control` with
  controller review action, `read-only-map --dry-run`, reward/default hint,
  review link, and explicit no-write boundary; after switching to the reward
  filter and selecting `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`, the packet updates to the
  reward goal and `record_human_reward_gate / neutral`.
- Browser DOM smoke: with no explicit `goalId`, `User Actions` appears before
  `Source`, the share target defaults to the first user-required action
  (`tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`, `Reward`), and `Copy Agent Prompt` is present.
- Browser DOM smoke: with a stale selected goal and `actionKind=reward`, the
  share target follows the reward card and rewrites the review link to
  `goalId=tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`.
- Browser DOM smoke: agent prompt text includes `goal-harness doctor`,
  `.goal-harness/registry.json`, the selected safe local path, and the
  boundary that the prompt is not reward append, approval, controller opt-in,
  or write-control.
- Browser DOM smoke: reward-focused first screen shows `Copy User Response`,
  `目标：tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`, and the Chinese
  `同意记录这次 human reward / 暂不同意记录这次 human reward` template with a
  no-write-control boundary.
- Browser DOM smoke: controller-focused first screen shows `Copy User Response`,
  `目标：agent-harness-main-control`, and the Chinese
  `同意继续 read-only/controller opt-in / 暂不同意，原因如下` template with a
  no-write-control boundary.
- Browser DOM smoke: first-screen sharing exposes exactly one
  `Copy Review Packet` button and no `Copy User Response` / `Copy Handoff` /
  `Copy Agent Prompt` buttons; `User Actions` remains before `Source`, shows
  `3 actions`, and the packet includes `Goal Harness Review Packet`, local
  dry-run preview, `human_reward overlay`, and the no-write-control boundary.
- Browser DOM smoke: selecting the controller card switches the shared packet
  target to `agent-harness-main-control`, updates the URL `goalId`, shows the
  `Selected` badge, and includes `read_only_controller_handoff_preview` plus a
  `read-only-map --dry-run` command.
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json check --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md --scan-path docs/status-data-contract.md`
- `cd apps/dashboard && npm run build`
- Browser DOM smoke: load
  `http://127.0.0.1:5173/?lane=all&severity=all&statusUrl=/status.local.json`
  and verify `User Review Map`, human-facing review copy,
  `Controller gated`, `Mapped`, and `Goal Directory`

- Browser smoke: click `Live` in `apps/dashboard` and verify it loads
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json status` includes `run_history`
  without local path keys
- Browser smoke: click `docs-maintenance-goal` in the attention queue and
  verify the run-history panel switches to the no-run state
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json status` includes
  `contract.checks`
- `python3 examples/render-status-dashboard.py examples/status.example.json /tmp/goal-status-dashboard.html`
- Browser smoke: verify Contract Health, Checks, and non-wrapping source
  controls in the React dashboard
- `goal-harness status` with a synthetic runtime verifies `human_reward`
  whitelist behavior and does not export unapproved reward keys
- `goal-harness reward` with a synthetic runtime appends a compact reward
  overlay, `status` merges it into one unique run, and private-looking reward
  text is rejected
- Browser smoke: select `experiment-controller-goal` and verify the dashboard
  shows Human reward without private fields
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format markdown status` shows the latest run
  `controller_readiness` classification when present in the compact index
- Browser smoke: select `experiment-controller-goal` and verify the dashboard
  shows Controller readiness and Human reward without private fields
- Browser smoke: verify `Goal Directory` renders bundled examples, hides the
  old `Queue Mix`, switches run history when selecting `docs-maintenance-goal`,
  and renders the live local 5-goal status export with public-safe domains
- Browser smoke: verify `Reward CLI Draft` appears for a selected goal with a
  compact run, includes `--dry-run` and `--run-generated-at`, and selected goals
  without compact runs show `needs run`
- `curl POST /reward/dry-run` against a synthetic loopback server returns
  `ok=true`, `appended=false`, and leaves the run index row count unchanged
- `goal-harness status` for the local multi-project registry shows
  `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc` with
  `controller_stage=ready_for_read_only_not_decision` and missing gates
  `human_reward_capture`, `aligned_eval_decision_evidence`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli new-project-prompt --project
  /tmp/demo-project --goal-doc /tmp/demo-project/GOAL.md` renders a Chinese
  handoff prompt without a placeholder `--next-probe`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json new-project-prompt --project
  /tmp/demo-project --goal-doc /tmp/demo-project/GOAL.md` exposes the prompt
  and connect command for scripts
- `HOME=$(mktemp -d) SHELL=/bin/zsh scripts/install-local.sh` creates a
  `~/.local/bin/goal-harness` symlink, adds a Goal Harness PATH block to
  `.zshrc`, and the installed wrapper runs `goal-harness --help`
- `scripts/install-local.sh && command -v goal-harness && goal-harness --help`
  verifies the current user shell can resolve and execute the CLI from any
  project directory
- `goal-harness doctor` and `goal-harness --format json doctor` verify current
  PATH, wrapper, symlink realpath, and Python import health
- `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json doctor`
  reports `ok=false`, `command_on_path=false`, and a concrete install/PATH fix
- `python3 -m py_compile goal_harness/*.py examples/render-status-dashboard.py`
- Synthetic project: `refresh-state --dry-run` returns `appended=false`, real
  `refresh-state` writes JSON/Markdown/index artifacts, and `status` maps the
  latest run to `state_refreshed -> codex`
- Latest zero-start project registry: `refresh-state --dry-run` reads the
  updated active state with `state_file 1/1`; real refresh appended a
  `state_refreshed` run at `2026-06-01T16:52:57+08:00`
- Multi-project status export now shows the zero-start project as
  `state_refreshed -> codex`
- `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --registry <private-multi-project-registry>
  --runtime-root <shared-runtime> --format json check --scan-path README.md
  --scan-path docs --scan-path examples --scan-path goal_harness --scan-path
  apps/dashboard/src --scan-path goals --scan-path scripts`
- `npm --prefix apps/dashboard run build`
- Browser smoke: load
  `http://127.0.0.1:5173/?lane=all&severity=all&statusUrl=/status.local.json`
  and verify the latest zero-start project row shows `state_refreshed`, Codex,
  and the refreshed-state action
- Synthetic project: `connect` auto-synced `auto-sync-demo` into a temp
  `registry.global.json`; `refresh-state` re-synced it; and `status` from a
  directory without `.goal-harness/registry.json` fell back to that global
  registry and showed `state_refreshed -> codex`
- Real sync: merged a private local registry and the latest zero-start project
  registry into the shared local global registry
- Default global status: `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --runtime-root
  <runtime-root> --format json status --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs`
  returns the global registry path, 6 goals, and 3 attention items
- Browser smoke: dashboard loaded `/status.local.json` generated from the
  global registry and showed the zero-start project as `state_refreshed`
- `HOME=$(mktemp -d) SHELL=/bin/zsh CODEX_HOME=<tmp> scripts/install-local.sh`
  creates both the CLI wrapper and `goal-harness-project` skill symlink
- `scripts/install-local.sh` on the current machine reports a local
  `goal-harness-project` skill install path
- `HOME=$(mktemp -d) SHELL=/bin/zsh scripts/install-local.sh` now validates the
  installed wrapper with `goal-harness doctor`
- `goal-harness status` for the local multi-project registry shows a newly
  connected zero-start project as `unregistered_runtime_goal` with controller
  readiness gates, while watch-only legacy runtime records remain out of the
  attention queue
- `HOME=$(mktemp -d) SHELL=/bin/zsh scripts/install-local.sh` writes the
  `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` shell profile block and the installed
  wrapper passes `goal-harness doctor`
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id orphan-goal` against a synthetic
  runtime returns `dry_run=true` and leaves the source directory in place
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id orphan-goal --execute` moves the
  synthetic runtime directory under `<runtime-root>/archived-goals/`
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id registered-goal` rejects a synthetic
  registry member unless `--allow-registered` is explicitly supplied
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id zero-start-project-goal` dry-runs a
  current unregistered runtime goal cleanup without moving files
- `goal-harness connect --goal-doc docs/GOAL.md` records
  `authority_sources[0].path == "docs/GOAL.md"` in the registry and renders
  `Primary goal document: docs/GOAL.md` in the initial state
- `goal-harness registry` renders `authorities=1` for a goal connected with a
  primary goal document
- Browser smoke: load the dashboard with `/status.local.json`, select
  `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`, and verify the queue gate hints plus next
  handoff condition are visible
- Browser smoke: load the React dashboard from a loopback `statusUrl`, click
  `Dry-run Check`, and verify the reward panel shows `validated` with
  `appended=false`
- `docs/dashboard-reward-write-boundary.md` is linked from README, integration,
  status contract, and experiment-controller milestone docs
- `goal-harness --registry ~/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json --format
  json status` run from a private project directory returns `ok=true`,
  `contract.summary.errors=0`, and `global_registry.summary.findings=0`
- Synthetic refresh dry-runs prove a public `## Next Action` line becomes the
  compact `recommended_action`, while an internal-document URL line is skipped
  in favor of the next public-safe action
- Real premium refresh at `2026-06-01T18:01:37+08:00` now shows the concrete
  GZXMT evidence-template action in global status and dashboard local JSON

## Guards

- Do not copy private registry entries, project paths, document links, task ids,
  credentials, or raw run payloads into public examples.
- Keep runtime data local; commit only sanitized docs, source, and examples.
- Prefer small, verified public-facing changes over broad rewrites.
