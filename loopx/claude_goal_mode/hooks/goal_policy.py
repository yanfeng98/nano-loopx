"""PreToolUse policy gate for goal-mode — OPTIONAL deterministic hardening.

In the native-`/loop` design, Claude Code's `/loop` is the runtime and loopx's
MCP `should_run` is the per-tick gate. This hook is NOT installed by default —
it is opt-in (`install.py --harden` / `connect.py --harden`), project-scoped, and
adds a per-TOOL-CALL gate on top of the loop:

- should_run gate (fail-closed)  -> may the agent spend this turn right now?
- Edit/Write -> write_scope        -> deny file edits outside the goal's scope
- Bash -> destructive denylist     -> deny obviously dangerous commands

It only acts in a project where loopx is armed (a `.claude/loop.md` exists).

Limitation (by design): Bash is gated only by a denylist, so a determined shell
command can still write outside write_scope or reach the network. For STRONG
isolation (untrusted code / unattended high-stakes), run Claude Code inside a dev
container or VM, which contains the whole process at the environment level.

Behavior (only while goal-mode is ARMED for the event's project):
- no goal here / goal-mode off            -> {} (no-op; normal permission flow)
- read-only/safe tools                    -> allow
- should_run == false (quota/gate closed) -> deny
- should_run probe unavailable (error)    -> deny for non-read-only tools (FAIL-CLOSED)
- should_run == true:
    * Edit/Write outside write_scope      -> deny
    * Edit/Write within write_scope       -> allow
    * destructive Bash                    -> deny
    * Bash / other                        -> allow

Fail-closed: if the deterministic ``should_run`` probe cannot be reached, a
non-read-only tool is denied rather than allowed, so a flaky/broken control
plane pauses delivery instead of running ungated. Read-only tools stay allowed.

Identity-aware: when the active goal registered an agent (loopx
``coordination.registered_agents``), the context carries ``agent_id`` and this
hook forwards it as ``--agent-id`` to ``loopx quota should-run``. Without it
loopx returns ``automation_prompt_upgrade_required`` and should_run=false — the
Claude Code analogue of Codex's identity-scoped heartbeat prompt.
