"""Host poll receipts for visible goal loops.

Long-running host loops (Pi goal extension and other generic-CLI drivers)
probe `quota should-run` on every settled turn or timer wake. When a driver passes `--record-host-poll`, the CLI writes a compact
receipt next to the goal state file so the control plane can distinguish a
live polling loop from a driver that died mid-wait.

The receipt is a small JSON file owned by LoopX, written atomically, and
stored beside the goal state file so it inherits the same ignore rules as
the rest of the project-local control-plane state.
