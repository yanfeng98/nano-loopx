"""File-backed coordination provider: one atomic CAS document per goal.

Storage plane only (RFC section 6.2): it serializes the opaque head it is
given, replaces the document atomically, and reports typed outcomes. It never
parses commands, mints clocks or leases, or interprets the head. Concurrency
is resolved by generation compare while holding the repository's one
cross-platform lock owner (``loopx.file_lock``) with its bounded deadline; a
lock that cannot be acquired in time is a typed ``failed`` because no write
was attempted.

Durability is a fixed commit sequence: write the complete canonical bytes to
an exclusive temporary file (short writes are continued, never ignored),
fsync the file, atomically rename it over the document, then fsync the parent
directory so the rename itself is durable. ``applied`` is returned only after
the whole sequence converges; any storage fault inside the sequence surfaces
as ``ambiguous`` so the authority reloads and trusts only its atomically
stored receipt index. The directory fsync makes the rename itself durable.
