Generic LoopX lifecycle. Keep project-specific branching out of the

output, `quota should-run.goal_boundary`, or boundary rules; if a lifecycle
rule is needed, update `{cli_bin} heartbeat-prompt` so all projects inherit it.
{scope_block}

Before spending delivery compute, make the CLI reachable; set
`LOOPX_TURN=<current_time_iso>` per trigger, reuse it on retries, and run guard:

```bash
{cli_preflight}
{pr_review_pre_quota_block}{quota_guard_command}
```

If that preflight still fails: no work/spend; quiet `DONT_NOTIFY`.

`agent_read_required`: drain/read/triage before work; settle/ACK.

{USER_TODO_FINAL_MESSAGE_RULE}
{HEARTBEAT_VISION_WRITEBACK_RULE_SHORT}

If the result says `should_run=false`:

- Only if `user_channel.notify=NOTIFY`, interpret `state=operator_gate` or
  `notify_user_on_open_todo=true` as a user prompt. Read `gate_prompt`,
  `operator_question`, `user_todo_summary`, and `open_todo_notify_reason`;
  ask one concise Chinese action/question with reply format. If
  `user_todo_summary.open_count > 0`, include up to three `first_open_items`;
  never say "no new user action". Honor
  `open_todo_notification_policy=repeat_until_resolved`; when
  `user_gate_notification_cooldown.notification_suppressed=true`, keep the gate
  pending and quiet until its reminder window/change. No gated delivery/spend.
  No delivery/spend on the gated path.
- If the payload also says `safe_bypass_allowed=true` and the same gate has
  already been surfaced, the gate blocks only the gated delivery path. You may
  do exactly one bounded safe-bypass step from the Priority Stack that does not
  depend on that gate; validate, write back, refresh accountable progress, spend
  once. Only if `user_channel.notify=NOTIFY`: report the result compactly; if
  `user_todo_summary.open_count > 0`, include those todos; if none exists, report
  the gate. Under `DONT_NOTIFY`, stay quiet after the safe-bypass work.
- If `effective_action=monitor_quiet_skip`, receipt/stall is written; quiet
  unless replan. On receipt write failure, retry same id. No edits/spend;
  receipts do not self-stop.
- If `waiting_on=external_evidence` or `state=waiting`, and this automation is
  explicitly a monitor, run at most one bounded read-only observation poll using
  project-approved status/log/metric/marker surfaces named in active state,
  `recommended_action`, or `goal_boundary.next_probe`. Unchanged evidence:
  quiet `DONT_NOTIFY`, no edits, no spend. New eval/fail/complete/blocker/
  approval/CI/deploy/data evidence: write back only allowed canonical
  state/board/ledger, add todos if needed, then spend once after validation.
  Only if `user_channel.notify=NOTIFY`: report the new evidence. Under
  `DONT_NOTIFY`, stay quiet.
  Still do not launch/stop/restart/sync/design code or mutate production unless
  `should_run=true` or the user explicitly authorizes it.
- Otherwise, do not do implementation work, adapter work, file edits, research,
  or project exploration in this turn. Return a quiet heartbeat `DONT_NOTIFY`
  response with the skip reason.
  {SCHEDULER_HINT_APPLICATION_RULE} Host cadence changes are
  scheduling updates only; they never consume quota or authorize delivery work.

If the result says `should_run=true`:

1. Read the active state, Priority Stack, recent progress, and critic.
   When you inspect current LoopX routing, use the current status queue:
   `attention_queue.items` and each item's `project_asset` are authoritative
   for owner, gate, waiting party, and next action. If `project_asset` is absent
   or legacy/raw fallback, raw queue fields are not owner/gate/stop authority. Treat
   `run_history.latest_runs` as evidence and drill-down only; it may be limited
   by status command limits or filters, so do not decide whether a gate is
   pending or approved from latest runs alone. Also inspect `goal_boundary` and
   guard `user_todo_summary`. Stop for an open user/owner todo only when it
   belongs to this goal's guard payload or current project asset and blocks the
   selected path; then use the blocker-push pattern above. Dependency or
   sibling-goal todos found in `attention_queue.items` should be recorded as
   dependency blockers; they must not consume the whole eligible turn. Choose a
   gate-independent P0/P1/P2 candidate for this goal when one exists.
   If `effective_action=outcome_floor_recovery` or
   `recovery_delivery_allowed=true` or
   `safe_bypass_kind=outcome_floor_recovery`, produce the required
   ranker/cross-domain evidence artifact named by `must_advance`, or write back
   the concrete blocker. Do not fall through to ordinary delivery,
   surface propagation, or synthetic-only chains.
   Read `execution_obligation`: `notify` is not an execution gate;
   `must_attempt_work=true` means one bounded segment even with
   `notify=DONT_NOTIFY`; quiet no-op needs `must_attempt_work=false` and
   `user_channel.notify=DONT_NOTIFY`. Use
   `scheduler_hint` for wakeup and unchanged-loop limits. For the hosted
   scheduler surface:
   `apply_needed=true` -> update `recommended_rrule` once; on success run
   `ack_hint.cli_args`; on failure/timeout do not retry or ack, run
   `failure_hint.cli_args` once. LoopX suppresses that target/host pair until
   either changes; continue under the observed host cadence. Else
   `ack_needed=true` -> run that bound ack directly; else skip.
   LoopX owns reset/progression state. It is scheduling only, not delivery
   permission. Then use
   `heartbeat_recommendation`: `recommended_mode=run_first_read_only_map` means
   run its `command` as a real read-only map, then
   validate/save the `read_only_project_map` result, refresh accountable
   progress, append exactly one heartbeat spend, sync state if needed; notify
   only under `NOTIFY`. If it says
   `recommended_mode=mapped_noop_if_unchanged` with `stop_if_unchanged=true`,
   and you find no new user instruction, owner evidence, agent todo, stale
   source, or safe handoff, return quiet `DONT_NOTIFY`: do not run, edit, or
   spend.
   Check `delivery_batch_scale`, `delivery_outcome`,
   `post_handoff_outcome_gap_streak`, and `handoff_delivery_contract`; for
   repeated-small or surface-only loops, obey the contract.
2. Run a short steering audit before choosing work: list at least three
   plausible next-action candidates across different P0/P1/P2 lanes when
   useful; if the same topic has consumed several recent delivery slices, apply
   a continuation check and state why continuing still wins; keep compute quota
   separate from focus quota; record any losing high-value candidate that should
   not be forgotten. Include a product bottleneck lens: ask whether the core
   goal is currently bottlenecked by user experience, agent capability,
   evidence quality, adapter readiness, or priority-rule gaps, and promote one
   concrete bottleneck candidate when it should outrank the nearest local TODO.
   Plan/top todo/route changes need todo/Next Action writeback or no-writeback rationale.
3. Run the no-progress self-repair check before choosing delivery work. Obey
   any machine-readable `autonomous_replan_obligation` or
   `execution_obligation.must_attempt_work=true` from `quota should-run`; that
   hard contract overrides a quiet no-op. Count a turn as no-progress only when
   it produced no substantive artifact, adapter/implementation progress,
   gate/user decision, or validation signal. If 2 consecutive eligible
   heartbeats are no-progress loops, run one bounded self-repair/replan segment
   before another quiet no-op. Delete/pause only when that repair path is stuck
   for 2 more eligible turns; no spend for the self-cancel turn.
4. Choose one bounded, verifiable progress segment from that audit. It may be a
   coherent batch across related implementation, test, doc, and state-writeback
   files when the write scope is clear and validation is explicit; it should not
   be forced into a tiny single-file step.
5. Do that segment only. Stay inside `goal_boundary` when present and keep
   public/private boundaries intact. Public-safe repo publication is not an
   operator gate by itself: for routine public project work, commit, push, and
   PR creation may proceed autonomously after validation and a clean
   public/private boundary scan. Stop and surface a user/controller gate only
   for private or company-internal material, credentials, destructive git
   operations, production actions, or repository rules that explicitly require
   review.
6. Run the smallest useful validation.
7. Write back changed files, validation, critic, and next action to the active
   state. If a user/owner todo appears, do not hide it in prose: use
   `{cli_bin} todo add --goal-id {goal_id} --role user --task-class user_gate --blocks-agent <agent-id>`
   or `{cli_bin} todo add --goal-id {goal_id} --role user --task-class user_action`.
   Use `--role agent` for project-agent follow-up work.
   {HOST_LOOP_TODO_CLOSEOUT_RULE}
   For the full field contract, see `docs/project-agent-todo-contract.md` in
   the LoopX checkout.
8. After validation/writeback, use actual class/scale/outcome; never default or
   upgrade to `multi_surface` / `outcome_progress`. Record accountable delivery:

   ```bash
   {progress_refresh_state_command}
   ```

   Spend consumes this causal record; plain state-only refresh cannot replace
   it. Run spend once as rendered; no pipe/filter/retry:

   ```bash
   {quota_spend_command}
   ```

   If spend output is ambiguous, verify with read-only quota status; never
   rerun.

   Do not append spend for quiet `should_run=false` skips, preflight failures,
   pure dry-run previews, or duplicate accounting attempts. If
   `should_run=false` but `safe_bypass_allowed=true` and you actually completed
   a bounded safe-bypass step, append this same spend event once after
   validation/writeback.

9. After spend, optionally refresh state-only:

   ```bash
   {refresh_state_command}
   ```

   Never emit accountable progress after spend; it creates an unspent record.

10. Return compactly under `interaction_contract.user_channel.notify`:
    `NOTIFY` only for concrete artifact/gate/blocker/self-stop when the
    authority is `NOTIFY`; otherwise stay quiet `DONT_NOTIFY`.

Output policy: authority=`interaction_contract.user_channel.notify`;
external=`NOTIFY`; quiet=`DONT_NOTIFY`; quiet_missing_action=`internal_repair`.

Safe bypass: `safe_bypass_allowed=true` -> one validated step before skip.
If `should_run=false`: `monitor_quiet_skip` -> receipt/stall; quiet unless
replan; failed write -> retry id; no edits/spend; receipts do not self-stop.

Honor repeat/cooldown. Wait
monitor: one read-only poll; unchanged quiet, new evidence writeback/spend.

If `should_run=true`:
1. Read active state, Priority Stack, progress/critic, `goal_boundary`,
   `attention_queue.items` / `project_asset`, and guard `user_todo_summary`.
   Legacy/raw fallback is not owner/gate/stop authority. Treat
   `run_history.latest_runs` as drill-down only.
2. Goal-owned blocker: stop its path. Under `NOTIFY`, send a concrete Chinese
   blocker-push; under `DONT_NOTIFY`, repair internally and stay quiet.
   Dependency/sibling todos: record; continue audit.
3. If `effective_action=outcome_floor_recovery` or
   `recovery_delivery_allowed=true` or
   `safe_bypass_kind=outcome_floor_recovery`, run only ranker/cross-domain
   evidence artifact or blocker recovery; no ordinary delivery or
   surface/synthetic-only work.
4. Follow `execution_obligation`: `notify` is not an execution gate.
   `must_attempt_work=true` means one bounded segment even with
   `notify=DONT_NOTIFY`; quiet no-op needs `must_attempt_work=false` and
   `user_channel.notify=DONT_NOTIFY`.
   Then follow `heartbeat_recommendation`:
   `run_first_read_only_map`: exact real-map, validate/save/refresh/spend;
   notify only under `NOTIFY`;
   `mapped_noop_if_unchanged` plus
   `stop_if_unchanged=true` means quiet no-op if no new instruction/evidence/
   todo/stale source/safe handoff.
   `task_orchestration_contract`: spawn admitted child lanes or resume peers;
   the coordinator alone accepts evidence and writes/spends once.
   Check `delivery_batch_scale`, `delivery_outcome`,
   `post_handoff_outcome_gap_streak`, `handoff_delivery_contract`; obey
   repeated-small/surface-loop contracts.
5. Run steering audit: compare P0/P1/P2, continuation checks,
   compute/focus quota, bottleneck lens.
6. no-progress self-repair: obey `autonomous_replan_obligation` or
   `execution_obligation.must_attempt_work=true`; after 2 eligible stall
   heartbeats with only status/brief checks, replan before quiet no-op.
   Pause/delete only if repair stays stuck 2 more turns.
7. Choose one bounded segment; coherent batch is OK with clear validation.
   Public-safe commit/push/PR may proceed after validation/clean scan. Stop for
   private/company material, credentials, destructive git, production, or review rules.
8. Validate; write files/validation/critic/next action to active state;
   use `{cli_bin} todo add --goal-id {goal_id} --role user --task-class user_gate|user_action`
   for owner todos and `--role agent` for agent todos, not prose.
   {HOST_LOOP_TODO_CLOSEOUT_COMPACT_RULE}
9. Account actual class/scale/outcome; no defaults. Refresh; spend once
   unpiped; never retry:

```bash
{progress_refresh_state_command}
{quota_spend_command}
```

10. Optional state-only post-spend: `{refresh_state_command}`; never accountable.

No spend for quiet skips, preflight failures, blocker-push asks, dry-runs,
self-cancel turns, or duplicate accounting.

Return only under `user_channel.notify=NOTIFY`; otherwise stay quiet.
